PREFACE.


‘German Composition’ is intended to be a Theoretical and Practical Guide
to the Art of Translating English Prose into good and idiomatic German.
It is arranged in such a manner that students who have reached the
fiftieth Lesson of the ‘German Manual’ may commence and advantageously
use it conjointly with that book. Being complete in itself, it is
likewise adapted for the use of any other students who, possessing a
knowledge of German Accidence and having had some practice in reading
German Prose, wish to acquire the Art of Translating English Prose into
German.

The book is calculated to serve the requirements of the B.A. Examinations
of the London and Victoria Universities, the Competitive Examinations
for the Civil and Military Service, the Oxford and Cambridge Local
Examinations for Senior Students, the Examination of the College
of Preceptors for First Class Candidates, and of similar Public
Examinations—all of which require the candidates to translate English
Prose into German.

I may conscientiously say that I have done all I could to make the book
attractive and useful. The selection of the Extracts has been made with
the greatest care directly from the works of the various authors, and is
the result of many years’ attentive reading and research. The pieces have
been almost exclusively chosen from the works of the best modern English
and American writers, and, it is hoped, will be found as interesting
and instructive as they are well adapted for translation into German.
They represent all the various styles of English Prose Composition, and
contain a great variety of subjects, as a glance at the various pages
will show; whilst the fact that the specimens, with only one or two
exceptions, are no mere fragments, but complete pieces in themselves,
must necessarily add to their value.

The Biographical Sketches of famous men and women, which at intervals
appear in the Notes and are always given in German, form a special
feature of the book. (Comp. S. 127, N. 1; S. 138, N. 12; and S. 156, N.
1.) They are of various lengths, according to their importance, and have
been written to add to the interest of the work and at the same time to
offer the student some useful material for reading German.

With respect to the help given in the Notes, I may state that I have
proceeded with the utmost consideration and care. The great object
I placed before me was to show, by precept and example, that a good
translation cannot be produced by the mere mechanical process of joining
together a number of words, as the dictionary may offer them at first
sight: but that it requires great thought and analytic power; that every
sentence, nay, almost every word, has to be weighed and considered with
respect to its true bearing upon the text; and that a good rendering is
only possible when the translator has grasped the true meaning of the
passage before him.

I have endeavoured to give neither too little nor too much help, but
whenever I found a difficulty which a student of average ability could
not fairly be expected to overcome, I have stepped in to solve it. For
this purpose I have made use of English equivalents and periphrases and
of Rules and Examples, and in cases where neither of these helps was
considered practicable I have not hesitated to give the German rendering
of the word or passage to be translated. The last mode of procedure,
however, I have adopted only when I found that the dictionaries in
ordinary use were insufficient, as is so frequently the case, and more
especially with respect to idiomatic passages, which it is impossible
to render successfully unless the translator is well versed in both
languages, and at the same time has undergone a thorough training in
the Art of Translating English into German, which the present volume
professes to teach. The plan of indicating the rendering of words and
phrases by means of English equivalents and periphrases must be of
evident advantage to the learner, for it teaches him how to think and
analyse, whilst it leads him to render the word or phrase correctly
without giving him the translation itself.

The Notes of Sections 1 to 150 and the Appendix contain in a concise and
lucid form almost all the rules relating to the German Syntax, and in
most instances these rules have been illustrated by practical examples
and models. The Appendix gives in thirty-seven paragraphs the Rules
referring to the Construction, the use of the Indicative, Subjunctive (or
Conjunctive), and Conditional Moods, which for convenient reference have
been reprinted from my ‘German Grammar,’ and to facilitate the student’s
work I have added an Index to the Grammatical Rules and Idiomatic
Renderings.

In a work containing such a great number of Extracts as the present,
there are, of course, many idioms and passages which may be correctly
translated in various ways, and I can therefore scarcely hope that all my
renderings will meet with the approval of every German scholar. I may,
however, confidently affirm here that I have devoted much thought and
labour to this publication, and that I have tried with all my heart to
make it acceptable to teachers and students alike.

In conclusion I respectfully tender my best thanks to the publishers—

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.


A second edition of this volume having been called for, I wish to express
my cordial thanks to the numerous colleagues and friends who adopted it
as a text-book for their classes.

As I am engaged in preparing, besides this book, a third edition of
two other volumes of my ‘German Course,’ and, at the request of the
Delegates of the University Press, also a Key to this volume, ‘German
Composition,’ I think the present moment opportune for introducing the
reformed German spelling which, by Government regulations, has been
taught in German schools for the last five or six years, and is becoming
more generally used from year to year in friendly intercourse, papers,
periodicals, literature, and commercial correspondence. It is but
fair that the students of German in this country should be taught to
spell in the simplified way now universally practised by their German
contemporaries. They will at least have nothing to unlearn then; and,
although the present spelling-reform may be considered but a compromise
between the older and the younger schools, there being a tendency in
the younger men to go even further than their older colleagues in the
simplification of our orthography and to make it still more phonetic and
uniform in principle, it will take a long time before the Government will
be moved to make modifications of any importance in their regulations.
I confidently trust that the great trouble I have bestowed upon the
revision of the present edition will be appreciated by teachers and
students alike. It will easily be seen that the alterations of the
orthography in the various books forming this ‘German Course’ must have
necessarily entailed a very considerable additional expense; but the
publication having met with much approval on the part of the public, I
was anxious to leave nothing undone in order to adapt it in every respect
to the requirements of the times and to make it still more useful.

On examination it will be seen that the changes made are not so many
as may be supposed, and that the principles underlying the German
spelling-reform are simple and easy to understand.

=At the end of the Appendix will be found a Synopsis of the principal
changes the German spelling has undergone, accompanied by Examples and a
few Exceptions to the general rules.=

DIRECTIONS FOR USING THE BOOK.


Each Section should first be prepared for _viva voce_ translation,
_with_ the assistance of the Notes in class; then translated in writing;
carefully corrected; and finally practised, by comparing the English text
with the corrected German version, FOR A SECOND _viva voce_ TRANSLATION
=until the student is able to translate the English text, _without_ the
assistance of the Notes in class, just as readily into correct German as
if he were reading from a German book=.

The Grammatical Rules given in the Notes should always be carefully
studied, and the reading of previously given Rules and the various
paragraphs of the Appendix referred to in the text should never be
omitted.

=The strict and conscientious observance of these directions is earnestly
requested.=

THE SECOND _viva voce_ TRANSLATION _without_ the assistance of the Notes
in class, as explained above, is especially of the greatest importance to
the student’s progress in the Art of Translating English into German, and
is the only way of mastering all the idiomatic and syntactic difficulties
contained in the Lessons and explained in the foot-notes. It commends
itself likewise as the best way of committing to memory the great number
of words and the various forms of construction occurring in the text,
and will gradually, but surely, lead to the acquisition of a good and
thorough German style of writing.

To be quite clear the Author ventures to propose the following


PLAN OF WORKING.

FIRST LESSON.

    Prepare for _viva voce_ translation Sections 1 and 2, WITH the
    assistance of the Notes in class.

SECOND LESSON.

    Translate in Writing Sections 1 and 2; and prepare for _viva
    voce_ translation Sections 3 and 4, WITH the assistance of the
    Notes in class.

THIRD LESSON.

    PREPARE FOR FLUENT AND CORRECT _viva voce_ TRANSLATION Sections
    1 and 2, WITHOUT the assistance of the Notes in class, by
    comparing the English text with the corrected German version;
    translate in Writing Sections 3 and 4; and prepare for _viva
    voce_ translations Sections 5 and 6, WITH the assistance of the
    Notes in class.

FOURTH LESSON.

    PREPARE FOR FLUENT AND CORRECT _viva voce_ TRANSLATION Sections
    3 and 4, WITHOUT the assistance of the Notes in class, by
    comparing the English text with the corrected version;
    translate in Writing Sections 5 and 6; and prepare for _viva
    voce_ translation Sections 7 and 8, WITH the assistance of the
    Notes in class;

    Then proceed in the same way throughout the book.

=It need scarcely be added that the quantity of work pointed out here
may be diminished or increased according to circumstances, and that the
longer sections towards the end of the book will in most cases require
the former course.=

The frequent attentive study of German literature will be a powerful
auxiliary to this book in imparting the Art of Translating English Prose
into German.

GERMAN COMPOSITION.


1. Words which, in the English text and in the periphrases of the English
text, are printed in _Italics_, must not be translated.

2. When two words are separated by a dash (—) in the Notes, they
represent the first and last word of a whole clause in the English text,
and the rendering refers to the clause thus indicated.

3. When two or more words are separated by dots (...) in the Notes, the
rendering refers to those words only.

4. The sign = is used in the meaning of: ‘is equivalent to’.

5. As a rule, the periphrases are given in correct English construction.




_Section 1._

A GOOD MAXIM[1].


My maxim is: never to begin[2] a book without finishing[3] it, never to
consider[4] it finished without[5] knowing it, and to study[6] it with[7]
a whole mind.—SIR THOMAS BUXTON.

[1] +Grundsatz+, m.

[2] to begin, +an´fangen+. When the =Infinitive= is used either
subjectively or objectively, it is generally preceded by the preposition
+=zu=+, and is called =Supine=. Comp. S. 78, N. 14, 1. To form the
=Supine Present= of compound separable verbs, like +an´fangen+, we must
place the preposition +zu+ between the separable prefix and the verb. The
Supine must be used here. See App. § 1.

[3] to finish, +beendigen+. The =Supine= is generally used for rendering
the =English Gerund= (i.e. the verbal in -ing) when the latter is
governed by a preposition, though, sometimes, this form may be rendered
by the help of the subordinative conjunction +~daß~+ and a finite verb
(i.e. one with a personal termination); as—

    He judges _without understanding_ anything about the matter.

    +Er urteilt, ~ohne~ etwas von der Sache ~zu verstehen~+, _or_
    +~ohne daß er~ etwas von der Sache ~versteht~.+

Use the Supine, which is always to be placed at the end of the clause.

[4] To consider a thing finished, +eine Sache ~als~ beendigt betrachten+.
The pronoun ‘it’ should begin the clause. See App. § 2.

[5] without — it, +ohne mit dem Inhalt desselben vertraut zu sein+.

[6] to study, +studie´ren+.

[7] with — mind = with undivided attention.




_Section 2._

WHAT IS ETERNITY?


_The_ following question was[1] put in writing[2] to a boy[3] in the
deaf-and-dumb school[4] at Paris: “What is eternity?” “It is the
life-time of the Almighty,” was the answer.—REV. R. K. ARVINE.

[1] Here the verb is in the Passive Voice. Remember that the =German
Passive Voice= is formed by the auxiliary +=werden=+. =The verb is in the
Passive Voice whenever the subject is suffering the action expressed by
the verb=; as—

    The castle _was built_ in the year 1609.

    +Das Schloß ~wurde~ im Jahre 1609 ~erbaut~.+

To put a question to a person, +einem eine Frage vor´legen+.

[2] in writing, +schriftlich+, which place before the p. p. (App. § 1).

[3] boy = pupil.

[4] +Taubstummenanstalt+, f.; render ‘in the’ by the gen. of the def.
art.; at = in.




_Section 3._

THE ACTION[1] OF[2] WATER.


The action of water on[3] our food[4] is very important. There[5] would
be no carrying of food into the system but for the agency of water. It
dissolves everything[6] that[7] we take[8], and nothing[9] that we take
as food can[10] become nutriment that[11] is not dissolved in water.—DR.
LANKESTER.

[1] ‘action’, here = operation, +Wirkung+, f.

[2] Use the gen. of the def. art. =The definite article= is always
required before nouns representing the whole of a given class, and before
abstract nouns taken in a general sense.

[3] on = upon.

[4] food = victuals, +Speisen+, pl.

[5] This sentence must be construed in a somewhat different way; say:
‘Without the agency (+Vermittelung+, f.) of water, no food (+Nahrung+,
f.) would be conveyed into the body,’ +würde dem Körper keine Nahrung
zu´geführt werden+.

[6] everything = all.

[7] ‘that’, here +~was~+. The indefinite relative pronoun +=was=+ is
the pronoun generally required after the indefinite numerals +alles+,
+etwas+, +manches+, +nichts+, +viel+, and +wenig+, after the indefinite
demonstrative pronoun +~das~+, and also after a superlative used
substantively; as +Das Schönste, was ich habe+.

[8] ‘To take’, when used of food, may be rendered by +essen+, +trinken+,
or +genießen+, which latter verb should be used here.

[9] ‘nothing — food’, may be briefly rendered by ‘+keine genossene
Speise+‘.

[10] can — nutriment = can serve as nutriment (+Ernährung+, f.). The verb
+dienen+ requires the prep. +zu+, which governs the dat. and must here be
contracted with the def. art. into +zur+: see N. 2.

[11] that — water = before (+ehe+, see App. § 17) the same (f.) is
dissolved in water.




_Section 4._

OF[1] WHAT USE IS IT?


When[2] Franklin made his discovery of the identity[3] of lightning[4]
and electricity[4], it[4] was sneered at[5], and _people_ asked: “Of
what use is it?” To[6] which his apt reply was: “What is the use of a
child?—It may[7] become a man!”—S. SMILES.

[1] Of — it, +Wozu nützt es?+

[2] ‘=When=’, referring to definite time of the Past, must always be
rendered by ‘+=als=+’.

[3] of the identity, _von der Identität_, f.; see S. 3, N. 2.

[4] When the agent from which the action proceeds is not mentioned, the
=English Passive Voice= is often rendered by a =reflective verb=, or by
the indefinite pronoun +=man=+ and a verb in the =Active Voice=; as—

    At last the book _was found_.

    +Endlich {~fand sich~} das Buch.+
            +{~fand man~ }+

Say ‘people (+man+) sneered at it.’

[5] _A._ To sneer at something, +über etwas spotten+; _B._ ‘=at it=’ =
there at, +=darüber=+. The English pronouns ‘=it=’, ‘=them=’, ‘=that=’,
and ‘=those=’, dependent on a preposition governing in German the dative
or accusative, are generally to be rendered by the pronominal adverb
‘+=da=+’ in combination with a corresponding preposition. This is always
the case when ‘it’ and ‘that’, in connection with a preposition are used
indefinitely, and frequently when either of these pronouns refers to a
noun representing an inanimate object or an abstract idea. The letter +r+
is inserted between the adverb +da+ and the preposition, whenever the
latter begins with a vowel.

[6] To — was = Upon this (+Hierauf+) he (inverted constr., see App. § 14)
gave _the_ following striking (+treffend+) answer.

[7] may = can; to become a man, +zum Manne werden+.




_Section 5._

WEALTH[1].


Wealth, after all[2], is[3] but a relative thing: for he who has[4]
little, and wants[5] still less, is richer than he who has much, and
wants still more.—REV. C. COTTON.

[1] wealth, +Reichtum+, m., see S. 3, N. 2.

[2] after all ... but, +doch immer nur+; a — thing, +etwas Relatives+.

[3] =When the subject, which may be preceded by its attributes, occupies
the first place in a principal clause, either the copula or the verb must
follow immediately.=

[4] to have = to possess.

[5] ‘to want’, here +bedürfen+.




_Section 6._

MENDELSSOHN IN BIRMINGHAM.


When[1] Mendelssohn, on[2] the first performance of his[3] ‘Elijah’ in
Birmingham, was about[4] to enter[5] the orchestra, he[6] said laughingly
to one of his friends and critics[7]: “Stick[8] your claws into me! Don’t
tell[9] me what you like, but[10] what you don’t like!”—ATHENÆUM.

[1] See S. 4, N. 2.

[2] The preposition ‘on’, signifying ‘on the occasion of’, must be
rendered by ‘+bei+’. ‘Performance’, +Aufführung+, f.

[3] Use the gen. of the def. art.; Elijah, +Elias+.

[4] ‘=to be about=’, +~im Begriff sein~+. ‘To be about’ may also be
rendered by the auxiliary verb of mood +~wollen~+ and the infinitive of
another verb; as—

    I _was_ just _about_ to leave, when the letter arrived.

    +~Ich war~ gerade ~im~ Begriff abzureisen+ (_or_ +~Ich wollte~
    gerade ~abreisen~+), +als der Brief ankam.+

[5] ‘to enter’, +betreten+, see S. 1, N. 2.

[6] Since the subordinate clause precedes the principal clause, the
construction of the principal clause must be inverted, see App. § 15.

[7] to — critics, say ‘to a friend and critic’, +Rezensent+, m.

[8] ‘Stick — me!’ This metaphor must be rendered freely by: +Packen Sie
mich nur tüchtig an!+

[9] tell = say; to like = to please, with the dat. of the person.

[10] The co-ordinative conjunction ‘=but=’ must be rendered by
‘+=sondern=+’, when, after a negative statement, the subsequent clause
expresses an idea altogether contrary to that of its antecedent.




_Section 7._

TO FORGIVE IS[1] TO FORGET.


“I can forgive, but I cannot forget,” is[2] only another way of saying:
“I will not forgive.” A wrong _once_ forgiven[3] ought[4] to be like[5] a
_cancelled_ note[6], torn in two and burned up, so[7] that it never can
be shown against the man.—REV. H. W. BEECHER.

[1] ‘to be’, here = to signify, +heißen+.

[2] is — saying = signifies only in (+mit+) other words. ‘+Das Wort+’ has
two plural forms with a different meaning to each: +die Wörter+, single,
unconnected words; +die Worte+, words connected into speech.

[3] _A._ Whilst the English Perfect Participle (commonly called Past
Participle) is placed both before and after the noun it qualifies, =the
German Past Participle used attributively, as a rule, precedes the
qualified noun=; as—

    We met with a ship _bound for Bremen_.

    +Wir trafen =ein nach Bremen bestimmtes Schiff=.+

_B._ Clauses containing a Perfect Participle, however, may also be
rendered by the help of a =relative pronoun=. Thus rendered, the
preceding sentence would read:

    +Wir trafen ein Schiff, =welches nach Bremen bestimmt war=+;

but the first rendering is certainly more concise than the second, and it
is to be preferred in all cases where the attributive construction would
not be too lengthy. ‘A wrong _once_ forgiven’, say ‘A forgiven wrong’,
and mark that: =When Participles are used attributively, and precede the
noun they qualify, they must be inflected like adjectives.=

[4] render ‘ought’ by the imperfect of +sollen+.

[5] like, +wie+.

[6] note, +Schuldschein+, m.; to tear in two, +zerrei´ßen+; to burn up,
+verbren´nen+. According to the rule given in N. 3, the participles of
these two verbs have to be placed before the noun ‘note’, which they
qualify.

[7] ‘so — man’, say ‘which never again can be used against the debtor’.
According to the hint given in S. 2, N. 1, the verb is in the passive
voice, and since the clause is a subordinate one, the verbs must stand at
the end of the clause. Place the p. p. first, and the copula (can) last.




_Section 8._

WHAT IS CAPITAL?


What is capital? Is[1] it what a man has? Is[2] it counted (App. § 31)
by[3] pounds and pence, stocks[4] and shares[5], by houses and lands[6]?
No! Capital[7] is not what a man has, but what a man is. Character[8]
is[9] capital; honour[10] is capital.—REV. DR. MACDUFF.

[1] ‘Is — has?’ say ‘Does it consist in that which (see S. 3, N. 7)
we possess?’ The prep. ‘in’ here governs the dat. Read again S. 4, N.
5, _B_, and notice that, when the =demonstrative pronouns= ‘that’ and
‘those’ are =followed by a relative pronoun=, they cannot be rendered by
the adverb ‘+da+’ in combination with a preceding preposition; as—

    We laughed _at that which_ (_or_ at what) you told us.

    +Wir lachten ~über das, was~ Sie uns erzählten.+

[2] See S. 2, N. 1; ‘to count’, here +schätzen+.

[3] by = +nach+.

[4] +Wertpapiere.+

[5] +Aktien.+

[6] +Ländereien.+

[7] ‘Capital — is’. The literal translation of this sentence would read
very awkwardly in German, say ‘Our capital does not consist in that which
we possess, but (S. 6, N. 10) in that which we are.’

[8] Character = A good reputation.

[9] ‘is’, here _ist_.

[10] +Ehrenhaftigkeit+, f.




_Section 9._

A GOOD RULE[1].


A French minister, who was alike[2] remarkable[3] for his[4] despatch of
business and _his_ constant[5] attendance at places of public amusement,
being[6] asked how he contrived to combine both _objects_, replied:
“Simply[7] by never postponing till to-morrow what should be done[8]
to-day.”—S. SMILES.

[1] +Lebensregel+, f.

[2] ‘alike ... and’, +sowohl ... wie auch+.

[3] to be remarkable for something, +sich durch etwas aus´zeichnen+.

[4] his — business, +schnelle Erledigung seiner Amtsgeschäfte+.

[5] constant — amusement, +regelmäßiger Besuch öffentlicher
Vergnügungsorte+. The prep. +durch+, which requires the acc., must be
repeated at the beginning of this clause.

[6] ‘being — replied’; this sentence requires an entirely different
construction in German, say ‘answered upon the question, how (App. §
16) he made it possible to combine both (neuter sing.)’. To combine,
+vereinigen+. The verb ‘to make’ must be placed in the Present
Subjunctive, since the clause contains an indirect question. Read
carefully App. §§ 28 and 30.

[7] Simply — to-morrow, +Einfach dadurch, daß ich nie auf morgen
verschiebe+.

[8] ‘to do’, here +erledigen+. See S. 2, N. 1, and place the verbs in the
order pointed out in S. 7, N. 7.




_Section 10._

ENGLAND UNDER THE RULE[1] OF[2] QUEEN VICTORIA.


The peace, the freedom, the happiness[3], and the order which Victoria’s
rule guarantees[4], are[5] part of my birthright as _an_ Englishman,
and I bless[6] God for my share[7]! Where else shall[8] I find such
liberty[9] of action, thought, speech[10], or[11] laws which protect me
so well[12]?—W. M. THACKERAY.

[1] rule = reign.

[2] Use the gen. of the def. art. The definite article is used in German
before names of persons when preceded by an adjective or a common name;
as—

    +Der arme Fritz!+

    Poor Fritz!

    +Der Kaiser Wilhelm.+

    Emperor William.

[3] happiness = well-being, +Wohlfahrt+, f. ‘Victoria’s rule’, say ‘the
reign of Queen Victoria’.

[4] to guarantee, +gewähren+.

[5] are part = form a part.

[6] I bless = I thank.

[7] share = lot.

[8] shall = can.

[9] +Freiheit des Handelns.+ Repeat the article before the two following
nouns. In German the =articles, possessive adjective pronouns, and other
determinative words= must be =repeated= when they are used in reference
to several nouns of different gender or number, whilst in English they
are only required before the first noun.

[10] Insert ‘and’ before ‘speech’, +Rede+, f., and place the verb
+finden+ immediately after that noun.

[11] Substitute the words ‘and where’ for the word ‘or’.

[12] +gut.+




_Section 11._

CONCENTRATION OF POWERS.


The weakest living creature[1], by[2] concentrating his powers on
a single object, can[3] accomplish something. The strongest[4], by
dispersing his over many, may fail to accomplish anything[5]. The drop,
by continually[6] falling[7], bores[8] its passage through the hardest
rock. The hasty[9] torrent rushes[10] over it with hideous uproar, and
leaves no trace behind.—T. CARLYLE.

[1] creature, +Wesen+, n.; strengthen the superlative of the adjective by
placing ‘aller’ before it, forming one compound expression, analogous to:
+Die aller schönste Blume+, the finest flower (of all).

[2] ‘by concentrating his powers’, +durch Konzentration seiner Kräfte+;
to accomplish something, +etwas zustande bringen+. Use the adverbial
expression ‘at least’ before ‘something’, which will give more force to
the German rendering.

[3] The copula ‘can’ must be placed immediately after the subject and its
attributes, as has been pointed out in S. 5, N. 2.

[4] The strongest — fail, +Dem Stärksten hingegen wird es durch
Zersplitterung seiner Kräfte nicht gelingen+.

[5] anything, +auch nur das Geringste+.

[6] continual, +unablässig+, adj.

[7] To render ‘falling’, form a noun of the verb ‘+fallen+’. The German
language makes frequent use of the =Infinitive Present= of verbs to form
=abstract nouns=, whilst the English language uses the Verbal in -ing for
that purpose. Such nouns are always of the neuter gender; as +das Gehen+,
going; +das Essen und Trinken+, eating and drinking.

[8] to bore one’s passage, +sich einen Weg bohren+. Place the verb
according to S. 5, N. 2; the adverbial clause ‘by continually falling’
must follow it.

[9] hasty, +ungestüm+; torrent, +Strom+, m.

[10] to rush over something, +über etwas hinweg´stürzen+; ‘rushes —
uproar’, say ‘rushes with hideous (+entsetzlich+) uproar (+Getöse+) over
the same.’




_Section 12._

COOLNESS[1].


Of the Duke of Wellington’s[2] perfect coolness on[3] the most trying
occasions. Colonel Gurwood gives[4] this instance. He was[5] once in
great danger of suffering[6] ship-wreck. It was bed-time[7] when (S. 4,
N. 2) the captain of the vessel came to him, and said: “It will soon be
_all_ over[8] with us!” “Very well,” answered the Duke, “then I (App. §
14) need not (App. § 12) take off[9] my boots!”—W. C. HAZLITT.

[1] +Kaltblütigkeit+, f.

[2] Place the genitive after the governing noun, and say: ‘Of (+Von+) the
perfect coolness of the Duke of Wellington.’ Perfect = great.

[3] ‘on — occasions’ = in the most dangerous (+gefahrvoll+) situations.

[4] to give = to relate. See App. § 14 for the construction. ‘This
instance’ = _the_ following example.

[5] ‘to be’, here +sich befinden+.

[6] Construe according to S. 1, N. 3.

[7] +Schlafenszeit+, f.

[8] +vorüber+.

[9] to take off, +aus´ziehen+, see S. 1, N. 2.




_Section 13._

RELIGIOUS TOLERATION[1].


When[2] certain persons attempted[3] to persuade Stephen[4], King of
Poland, to constrain[5] some of his subjects, who[6] were of a different
religion, to embrace[7] his, he said[8] to them: “I[9] am king of men,
and not of[10] consciences[11]. The[12] dominion of conscience belongs
exclusively to God.”—REV. R. K. ARVINE.

[1] +Religionsduldung+, f.

[2] ‘When’, here?

[3] attempted to = would, impf. of +wollen+.

[4] Say ‘the king Stephen of Poland’. +König Stephan von Bathori regierte
von+ 1576-1586.

[5] +zwingen+. Place the verb after the relative clause, since =the
relative pronoun should follow its antecedent as closely as possible=.

[6] ‘who — religion’, say ‘who belonged to another religion’.

[7] to embrace = to accept.

[8] ‘to say’, here ‘to reply’, +entgegnen+.

[9] I — men = I rule (+herrschen+) over men.

[10] of = over.

[11] This noun is not used in the plural in German. See S. 3, N. 2.

[12] ‘The — God’, say ‘God alone rules over consciences (sing.)’.




_Section 14._

HOW HUGH MILLER[1] BECAME _A_[2] GEOLOGIST.


Hugh Miller’s[3] curiosity[4] was[5] excited by _the_ remarkable traces
of extinct[6] sea-animals in[7] the Old Red Sandstone, on which he
worked as a quarryman. He inquired[8], observed, studied, and became
_a_ geologist. “_It was_ the necessity”, said he, “which made[9] me a
quarrier, _that_ taught me to be a geologist.”—S. SMILES.

[1] +Hugh Miller wurde am 10ᵗᵉⁿ Oktober 1802 von armen Eltern zu Cromarty
in Schottland geboren. Er arbeitete 15 Jahre als gemeiner Steinbrecher,
beschäftigte sich jedoch während jener Zeit mit litterarischen und
wissenschaftlichen Arbeiten, besonders mit der Geologie, der er ganz neue
Bahnen eröffnete. Durch seine Werke hat er sich in der Wissenschaft einen
unsterblichen Namen erworben, und als er am 24ˢᵗᵉⁿ Dezember 1856 starb,
verlor Schottland in ihm einen seiner besten Söhne, und die Geologie
einen ihrer beredtesten und ergebensten Lehrer.+

[2] Contrary to English construction, =the indefinite article is not used
in German in stating the business or profession of a person=; as—

    He wants to be _a_ soldier.

    +Er will Soldat werden.+

=Exception:= When the noun denoting the business or profession is
preceded by an adjective, the indefinite article is used in German, as in
English:

    His father was a clever physician.

    +Sein Vater war ein geschickter Arzt.+

[3] When a =Proper Name= is used in the =Genitive Case=, it is generally
placed before the governing noun, as in English: Schiller’s poems,
+Schillers Gedichte+.

[4] +Wißbegierde+, f.

[5] How is the Passive Voice to be recognised? ‘To excite’, here +lebhaft
an´regen+; construe accord. to S. 13, N. 5.

[6] +aus´gestorben.+

[7] in — sandstone, +in einem alten Rotsandsteinlager+; on which = where.

[8] ‘to inquire’, here +Nachforschungen anstellen+.

[9] ‘to make’ requires here the prep. +zu+ contracted with the def. art.;
‘that — geologist’, +machte mich schließlich auch zum Geologen+.




_Section 15._

EXTREMES MEET[1].


When Diogenes, during the famous festival[2] at Olympia[3], saw[4]
some young men of Rhodes arrayed[5] most magnificently, he (App. § 15)
exclaimed smiling: “This is pride!” And when, afterwards[3], he met[6]
with some Lacedæmonians in _a_ mean[7] and _sordid_[8] dress, he said:
“And this is also pride!”—REV. R. K. ARVINE.

[1] +Die Extreme berühren sich.+

[2] the festival at Olympia, +die Olympischen Feste. Diese berühmten
Feste, auch Olympische Spiele genannt, wurden in jedem fünften Jahre am
ersten Vollmond nach der Sonnenwende (Anfang Juli) bei Olympia zu Ehren
des Zeus gefeiert. Sie dauerten fünf Tage und bestanden in Wettrennen (zu
Wagen, zu Pferd und zu Fuß) und in gymnastischen Spielen aller Art.+

[3] Contrary to English practice, =the comma is, as a rule, not used
in German to enclose adverbs or adverbial clauses of time, manner, and
place=.

[4] ‘to see’, here +erblicken+, which place after ‘Rhodes’; young men =
youths; ‘of’, here +aus+; Rhodes, +Rhodus+.

[5] ‘arrayed — magnificently’. Turn these words into a relative clause,
and say: ‘which were most magnificently (+aufs prächtigste+) arrayed
(+schmücken+)’, according to the rule given in S. 7, N. 3, _B_.

[6] to meet with a person, +einem begegnen+. Place the subject
immediately after ‘when’. The Lacedæmonian, +der Lazedämonier+.

[7] +armselig.+

[8] +zerlumpt.+




_Section 16._

POOR PAY[1].


When the Duke of Marlborough, immediately after the battle of
Blenheim[2], observed[3] a soldier leaning[4] pensively on the butt-end
of his musket, he accosted[5] him thus: “Why so pensive[6], my friend,
after so[7] glorious a victory?” “It may be glorious[8],” replied the
brave fellow, “but[9] I am thinking that all _the_ human blood I[10] have
spilled this day[11] has only[12] earned me fourpence.”—REV. R. K. ARVINE.

[1] +Armselige Bezahlung.+

[2] +Die Schlacht bei Blindheim+ (Engl. ‘Blenheim’) +wurde am 13ᵗᵉⁿ
August 1704 von dem Herzog von Marlborough in Verbindung mit dem
östereichischen Prinzen Eugen gegen die Franzosen gefochten. Blindheim
ist ein kleines bayerisches Dorf bei Höchstädt, an der Donau. Die
Schlacht wurde zu gunsten der Verbündeten entschieden, und der Herzog von
Marlborough erhielt für diesen glänzenden Sieg von der Königin Anna ein
prachtvolles Schloß+ (Blenheim House) +bei Woodstock in Oxfordshire zum
Geschenk.+

[3] Place the verb ‘observed’ after the noun ‘soldier’.

[4] ‘leaning — musket’. This passage must be changed into a relative
clause, thus: ‘who leant (+sich stützen+) pensively (+gedankenvoll+) upon
the butt-end (+Kolben+, m.) of his musket’, for: =Sentences containing
a Present Participle which qualifies a preceding noun or pronoun, are
generally turned into relative clauses=; as—

    The teacher, _noticing_ the boy’s talent, applied to the prince
    on his behalf.

    +Der Lehrer, ~welcher~ das Talent des Knaben ~bemerkte~,
    verwendete sich für ihn bei dem Fürsten.+

[5] to accost, +anreden+; thus, +folgendermaßen+.

[6] here ‘+nachdenkend+’ in order to avoid the repetition of the same
word.

[7] so ... a, +ein ... so+.

[8] Make the word ‘glorious’ emphatic by placing it at the head of the
clause, and see App. § 14. Insert the adverb ‘+wohl+’ between the subject
and the verb ‘be’, which will render the sentence more idiomatic.

[9] but — thinking, +aber ich bedenke+.

[10] Supply the relative pronoun ‘which’, for: =The relative pronoun can
never be omitted in German=; to spill, +vergießen+.

[11] this day = to-day.

[12] This work has only earned me a shilling, +diese Arbeit hat mir nur
einen Schilling eingebracht+.




_Section 17._

THE WORLD IS A LOOKING-GLASS.


We[1] may be pretty certain that persons[2] whom all the world treat
ill, deserve entirely[3] the treatment they[4] get. The world is a
looking-glass, and gives[5] back to every man the _reflection_ of his
own face. Frown[6] at it, and[7] it will in turn look sourly upon you;
laugh[8] at it and with it, and[9] it is a jolly, kind companion[10].—W.
M. THACKERAY.

[1] We — certain. +Wir können uns ziemlich sicher darauf verlassen.+

[2] persons — ill = those who have to suffer from everybody.

[3] +vollkommen.+

[4] they get, +welche ihnen zuteil wird+.

[5] to give back the reflection = to reflect, +zurück´werfen+; every man,
+jeder+; face = image.

[6] to frown at a person, here ‘+einen mürrisch an´blicken+’; use the
second pers. sing.

[7] and — you, +und sie wird auch auf dich verdrießlich
hernie´derschauen+.

[8] ‘Laugh at it’ seems to be used here in the sense of: ‘Smile at it’.
Say: ‘Smile at it, laugh with it’, etc. ‘To smile at a person’, here
‘+einen freundlich an´blicken+’.

[9] ‘and — is’, say: ‘and it will be for thee (+dir+)’.

[10] +Gefährtin.+




_Section 18._

GIVE[1] THE HONOUR TO GOD ALONE.


A lady applied[2] to the worthy philanthropist[3] Richard Reynolds
on behalf of a little orphan boy. After he[4] had (App. § 17) given
liberally[5], she said: “When[6] he is old enough, I (App. § 15) will
teach[7] him to thank his benefactor.” “Stop[8],” said the good man,
“thou art mistaken[9]. We do not thank the clouds for rain (S. 3, N.
2). Teach[10] him to look higher, and thank Him[11] who giveth both the
clouds and the rain.”—REV. R. K. ARVINE.

[1] Say ‘Give God alone the honour’.

[2] to apply to a person _on behalf of_ somebody, +sich bei einem ~für~
jemand verwenden+.

[3] +Menschenfreund+, m.

[4] To avoid ambiguity turn the pron. ‘he’ here by ‘Reynolds’.

[5] ‘liberally’, here +reichlich+.

[6] The conjunction ‘=when=’, used in the sense of ‘=whenever=’, and
referring to indefinite time, must be rendered by ‘+=wenn=+’ (compare S.
4, N. 2); as—

    _When_ (whenever) my old teacher came to Hamburg, he always
    stayed with me.

    +~Wenn~ mein alter Lehrer nach Hamburg kam, wohnte er stets bei
    mir.+

[7] The verb ‘+lehren+’, to teach, requires the accusative of the person.
Render the sentence ‘I — benefactor’ by ‘I will teach him to be thankful
to his benefactor’.

[8] +Halt´!+

[9] to be mistaken, +sich irren+.

[10] Teach — higher, +Lehre ihn höher blicken+.

[11] The pronoun ‘Him’ is here used as a demonstr. pron.; ‘both ... and’,
+sowohl ... wie auch+; ‘to give’, here = to send.




_Section 19._

HOW DID CUVIER[1] BECOME A NATURALIST?


When young (S. 10, N. 2) Cuvier was one day[2] strolling[3] along the
sands near Fiquainville, in Normandy[4], he observed a cuttle-fish
lying[5] stranded on the beach. He was attracted[6] by the curious
object, took it home to[7] dissect, and[8] began the study of the
mollusca, which ended in his becoming one of the greatest among natural
historians.—S. SMILES.

[1] +G. D. Cüvier, berühmter französischer Naturforscher (1769-1832),
erhob die vergleichende Anatomie zuerst zur Wissenschaft.+

[2] one day, +eines Tages+; one morning, +eines Morgens+; one evening,
+eines Abends+, etc.

[3] to stroll along the sands, +an der Küste umher´schlendern+, ‘near’,
here +von+.

[4] +die Normandie+, always used with the def. art.

[5] ‘lying — beach’, say ‘which the sea had washed (+spülen+) upon the
beach’. (See App. § 17.)

[6] to be attracted by something, +sich durch etwas an´gezogen fühlen+;
‘object’, here ‘creature’.

[7] The =Supine= is used to express =purpose=, and must be employed
whenever the English ‘=to=’ is used in the meaning of ‘=in order to=’, or
‘=for the purpose of=’; clauses of this sort are generally introduced by
the conjunction ‘+=um=+’; as—

    I will take this animal home _to_ dissect.

    Ich will dies Tier mit nach Hause nehmen, um es ~zu~ sezieren.

[8] ‘and — historian’, say ‘began (+an´fangen+) to study the mollusca,
and became finally (+schließlich+) one of the greatest natural
historians’. Mollusca, +Mollusken+ or +Weichtiere+.




_Section 20._

ON THE CHOICE OF BOOKS[1].


In literature (S. 3, N. 2) I am fond[2] of confining myself to the best
company, which consists chiefly of old acquaintances[3] with whom I am
desirous of becoming more intimate, and I suspect[4] that, nine[5] times
out of ten, it is more profitable[6], if not more agreeable, to read an
old book over again, than[7] to read a new one for the first time.—LORD
DUDLEY.

[1] ‘of books’, here +der Lektüre+.

[2] _A._ The verbs ‘=to be fond of=’ and ‘=to like=’ are often rendered
by the auxiliary verb of mood ‘+=mögen=+’, either with or without the
adverb ‘+gerne+’ or ‘+gern+’ (willingly), which is used to intensify its
signification; as—

    _I am_ very _fond of_ the German language.

    +Ich ~mag~ die deutsche Sprache sehr ~gern~.+

    _Are you fond of_ walking?

    +~Mögen Sie gerne~ spazieren gehen?+

    _I don’t like_ this child.

    +~Ich mag~ dies Kind ~nicht~.+

_B._ But the adverb +=~gerne~=+ or +=~gern~=+ in itself denotes liking
and fondness, and is therefore the general translation of the verbs ‘to
be fond of’ or ‘to like’ when used with the infinitive of other verbs; as—

    _I like_ to dance.

    +Ich tanze ~gern~.+

    _We are fond of_ confining ourselves to a few old books.

    +Wir beschränken uns ~gern~ auf einige wenige alte Bücher.+

Construe the above clause accord. to the last example given.

[3] acquaintances = friends; I am desirous of becoming = I wish to become
(App. § 19). The insertion of the adverb ‘+noch+’ before the comparative
will greatly improve the rendering of this clause.

[4] to suspect = to believe.

[5] ‘nine times out of ten’ may be briefly rendered by the adverbial
expression +meistenteils+, which place immediately after the subject of
the subordinate clause.

[6] profitable, +nützlich+; ‘if — agreeable’, say ‘if not even (+gar+)
more agreeable’; ‘over again’, here +noch einmal+.

[7] ‘than — time’, say ‘than to occupy oneself (+sich beschäftigen+)
with a new _one_’. This periphrase is necessary to avoid a monotonous
repetition in German.




_Section 21._

AN APPARENTLY INSIGNIFICANT FACT[1] OFTEN[2] LEADS TO GREAT RESULTS.


When Galvani[3] discovered that a frog’s leg[4] twitched when placed in
contact with different metals, it[5] could scarcely have been imagined
that so apparently insignificant a fact would ever lead (App. § 17) to
important results. Yet therein lay the germ of[6] the Electric Telegraph,
which[7] binds the intelligence of continents together, and probably
before many years elapse will[8] “put[9] a girdle round the globe.”—S.
SMILES.

[1] +Thatsache+, f.

[2] See S. 5, N. 2, and place the adverb after the verb; ‘result’,
+Resultat+, n.

[3] +Luigi Galvani, italienischer Anatom, entdeckte 1780 den
Galvanismus.+ ‘When — discovered’, say ‘When Galvani made the discovery’.

[4] ‘leg’, here +Schenkel+, m.; to twitch, +in Zuckungen geraten+; when
placed = when (S. 18, N. 6) the same was (S. 2, N. 1) brought.

[5] it — imagined, +hätte man sich kaum vorstellen können+; ‘that so

_Section 22._

OATS[1].


Oats are (S. 2, N. 1) chiefly used whole[2] as food for horses. Ground[3]
into meal, they are used in some countries (especially in Scotland)
for[4] making porridge and cakes. As[5] a plant, it is extremely hardy,
and grows where neither wheat nor barley could[6] be made productive.
For[7] this reason it is a favourite crop in mountainous countries and
moist climates—for example in Scotland and Wales. It (S. 5, N. 2) also
grows luxuriantly in Australia, Northern[8] and Central Asia, and in
North America.—NELSON’S READERS.

[1] +Der Hafer+, which noun is never used in the plural.

[2] whole, +ungemahlen+; to use, +benutzen+; food for horses,
+Pferdefutter+, n.

[3] Ground — meal, +zu Mehl vermahlen+; they — used = one uses
(+gebrauchen+) it (m.). see S. 4, N. 4; ‘country’, here +Gegend+.

[4] for — cakes, +um Mehlsuppe und Kuchen daraus zu machen+.

[5] ‘As — hardy’, say ‘The plant is extremely hardy (+kräftig+)’.

[6] could — productive = would thrive.

[7] For — reason, +Daher+, adv., App. § 14. Render the pron. ‘it’ by
‘+der Hafer+’; a favourite crop, +das Hauptgetreide+.

[8] in +Nord- und Mittelasien+.




_Section 23._

SPRING-BLOSSOMS[1].


The blossoms of Spring are as brief[2] as _they are_ beautiful. For[3]
_a_ short time they embellish the country, spreading[4], as it were, a
bridal veil over every[5] tree and hedge. It seems, indeed[6], as if
Nature had given them existence only to (S. 19, N. 7) show their worth,
and then to destroy them. Yet[7] they are “fair pledges of a fruitful
tree,” and teach us the solemn[8] lesson—that[9] everything lovely on
earth is destined soon to perish, and[10] like them to glide into the
grave.—REV. E. M. DAVIES.

[1] +Frühlingsblüten.+

[2] +vergänglich.+

[3] +Auf+; to embellish, +schmücken+.

[4] spreading = and spread; as it were, +gleichsam+.

[5] ‘every — hedge’, say ‘hedges and trees’.

[6] +wirklich+; as — only, +als hätte die Natur ihnen nur das Dasein
verliehen+.

[7] ‘Yet — tree’, say ‘They are however the lovely messengers
(+Vorboten+) of a fruitful (+fruchtreich+) tree’.

[8] solemn lesson, +ernste Wahrheit+.

[9] that — perish, +daß alles Schöne auf Erden der Vergänglichkeit
geweiht ist+.

[10] ‘and — grave’, say ‘and like the blossoms must (App. § 18) glide
(+sinken+) into an early grave’.




_Section 24._

THE WINKING[1] EYELID.


The[2] object of winking is a very important one. An outside[3] window
soon (S. 5, N. 2) gets soiled[4] and dirty, and a careful shopkeeper[5]
cleans his windows every morning. But our eye-windows must[6] never have
so much as a speck or spot upon them; and the winking eyelid[7] is the
busy apprentice who, not once a day, but[8] all the day, keeps the living
glass[9] clean; so that, after all[10], we are little worse off than the
fishes, who[11] bathe their eyes and wash their faces every moment.—PROF.
G. WILSON.

[1] +Das Öffnen und Schließen der Augenlider.+

[2] ‘The — one’, say ‘The opening and closing of the eyelid (pl.) is of
great importance.

[3] outside window = street window.

[4] +trübe.+

[5] +Ladenhüter+; supply the adv. ‘therefore’ after the verb ‘cleans’,
and place the object last of all.

[6] ‘must — them’, say ‘must (+dürfen+) never suffer (+erleiden+) even
(+selbst+) the smallest speck, the least dimness (+Trübung+).

[7] +das sich öffnende und schließende Augenlid+; ‘apprentice’, here
+Ladenbursche+.

[8] but — day, +nein, den ganzen Tag hindurch+.

[9] +Augenglas.+

[10] +genau betrachtet+; the subject should be placed immediately after
the conjunction ‘that’; little = not much; to be badly off, +schlimm
daran sein+.

[11] who — moment, +welche Augen und Gesicht jeden Augenblick baden und
waschen+.




_Section 25._

A GOOD EXAMPLE.


It is reported that, one day (S. 19, N. 2), the[1] two great philosophers
Aristippus[2] and Æschines had fallen at variance[3]. The[4] following
day, however, Aristippus came to[5] Æschines, and said: “Shall[6] we be
friends?” “Yes, with[7] all my heart!” answered Æschines. “Remember[8],”
continued Aristippus, that[9] though I am your elder, yet I sought for
peace. “True[10],” replied Æschines, “and for this[11] I will always
acknowledge you to be the more worthy man, for[12] I began the strife,
and you the peace.”—REV. J. BURROUGHS.

[1] Place the subject immediately after the conj. ‘that’.

[2] +~Aristippus~ aus Cyrene wurde (380 v. Chr.) Stifter der cyrenaischen
Philosophenschule, welche die Lehre aufstellte, daß das höchste Glück des
Menschen im sinnlichen und geistigen Vergnügen zu suchen sei. Aristippus
war ein Zeitgenosse des Socrates und der einzige Philosoph seiner Zeit,
der sich seine Vorträge mit Geld bezahlen ließ. ~Äschines~ war ein
Nebenbuhler und Gegner des Demostenes, wurde (389 v. Chr.) zu Athen
geboren, lebte später zu Rhodus und siedelte endlich nach Samos über, wo
er (314 v. Chr.) starb.+

[3] to fall at variance, +sich überwer´fen+.

[4] The = On the; however, +jedoch+, which must not be placed between
commas.

[5] Use here the def. art. contracted with the prep. +zu+ into +zum+,
for: =The def. art. is often used to mark the Gen. Dat. and Acc. of
proper names.=

[6] Shall = Will.

[7] +von ganzem Herzen!+

[8] +Erinnere dich daran.+

[9] Say ‘that I have sought for peace, although I am the elder’; to seek
for peace, +um den Frieden nach´suchen+.

[10] Say ‘That is true’.

[11] +deshalb+, adv. (App. § 14). He acknowledged you to be the more
worthy man (of us two), +Er erkannte dich ~als~ den Würdigeren von uns
beiden an+; construe according to this example, and supply the expletive
‘auch’ after the object ‘you’.

[12] +denn ich war der erste zum Streit, und du zum Frieden.+




_Section_ 26.

DESCRIPTION OF A GLACIER.


I must now explain to you[1] what a glacier is. You see before you[2]
thirty or forty mountain-peaks, and between these peaks what[3] seem to
you frozen rivers. The snow, from[4] time to time melting and dripping
down the sides of the mountain, and congealing in the elevated hollows
between the peaks, forms a half-fluid mass, a river of ice[5], which
is called (S. 4, N. 4) _a_ glacier. As[6] the whole mass lies upon
a slanting surface, and is not entirely solid throughout, it[7] is
continually pushing, with a gradual but imperceptible motion, down[8]
into the valley below.—MRS. BEECHER STOWE.

[1] Use the 2nd pers. sing.

[2] Place the words ‘before you’ after the object.

[3] +glaubst du zu Eis erstarrte Flüsse zu erblicken.+

[4] which (App. § 16) from time to time melts, drips down on the
mountain-sides (+Bergabhänge+), and congeals (+gefrieren+), etc., see
S. 16, N. 4. Supply the adverb wieder before the verb ‘congeals’. The
elevated hollow, +die höher gelegene Felsspalte+.

[5] +Eisstrom+, m.

[6] As = Since, +da+ (App. § 16); to be entirely solid throughout, +durch
und durch fest sein+.

[7] it — pushing, +so senkt sie sich fortwährend+; with a ... but, +mit
einer zwar ... doch+.

[8] down — below, +in das unten liegende Thal hinab+.




_Section 27._

WITHOUT[1] PAINS NO GAINS.


It was one of the characteristic qualities of Charles James Fox[2],
that[3] he was thoroughly pains-taking in all that he did. When[4]
appointed Secretary of State, being[5] piqued at some observation as to
his bad writing, he actually took[6] a writing-master, and wrote copies
like a schoolboy until he had sufficiently improved himself. Though[7] a
corpulent man, he[8] was wonderfully active at picking up tennis-balls,
and[9] when asked how he contrived to do so, he playfully replied:
“Because[10] I am a very pains-taking man.” The same accuracy which he
bestowed upon trifling matters[11], was displayed by him in things of
greater importance; and[12] he acquired his reputation by “neglecting
nothing.”—S. SMILES.

[1] +Ohne Mühe kein Gewinn.+

[2] +Ich möchte vorschlagen zu übersetzen+: ‘of the famous Ch. J. Fox’,
+weil dadurch das Verhältnis des Genitivs ganz klar ausgedrückt wird.
~Charles James Fox~ (1749-1806) ward schon 1768 Mitglied des Unterhauses,
1772 Lord des Schatzes, und bildete 1783 mit North und Portland ein
Ministerium, welches jedoch bald dem Ministerium Pitt weichen mußte.
Er begann darauf mit Burke und andern eine großartige parlamentarische
Opposition gegen Pitt und kämpfte von 1792-97 fast allein gegen eine
starke Majorität. Im Jahre 1806, kurz vor seinem Tode, wurde er mit
Granville nochmals ans Staatsruder berufen.+

[3] +daß er sich in allem, was er that, die größte Mühe gab.+

[4] When he was appointed (see N. 7). The verbs +~machen~+ (to make),
+~ernennen~+ (to appoint), and +~erwählen~+ (to choose, to elect), and
other =verbs denoting choosing or appointing=, require in German the
prep. +zu+ contracted with the def. art., whilst in English they govern
_two_ Nominatives in the Passive Voice; as—

    +Der Freund meines Vaters ist zum Abgeordneten ~erwählt
    worden~.+

    My father’s friend has been elected a member of Parliament.

[5] being — writing. This clause must be rendered in an altogether
different form; let us say ‘and felt hurt by an observation as to
(+über+) his bad hand-writing’. To feel hurt by something, +sich durch
etwas verletzt fühlen+. The p. p. must be placed?

[6] ‘to take’, here +engagie´ren+; ‘actually’, here +faktisch+ (see App.
§ 15); to write copies, +sich im Schönschreiben üben+; improved himself =
improved his hand-writing.

[7] Though he was. Grammatical distinctness, as a rule, requires that the
=subject and copula=, which after certain conjunctions are so frequently
omitted in English, =should be clearly expressed in German=.

[8] When a subordinate clause, beginning with one of the conjunctions
+~da~+, +~obgleich~+, +~weil~+, and +~wenn~+, precedes a principal
clause, which is often done for the sake of emphasis, the =principal
clause= is generally =introduced by= the adverbial conjunction +=so=+
(so, thus, therefore); as—

    +~Da~ es regnet, ~so~ können+ (App. § 15) +wir nicht ausgehen.+

    As it is raining, we cannot go out.

‘He — balls’, +so war er im Auffangen der Bälle beim Tennisspiele doch
merkwürdig gewandt+.

[9] ‘and — so’, say ‘and when (S. 18, N. 6) one asked him how he did
(+machen+) it’. The verb +machen+ should be used in the Pres. Subj.,
since the clause contains an indirect question (App. §§ 28 and 30).
Playfully, +scherzend+.

[10] +Weil ich mir stets die größte Mühe gebe.+

[11] trifling matters, +Kleinigkeiten+; ‘was — importance’, say ‘he
showed also in more important matters’ (+Angelegenheiten+).

[12] and — nothing, +und er erwarb sich seinen Ruf dadurch, daß er nichts
für zu gering erachtete+.




_Section 28._

THE MAGNA CHARTA[1].


The great-grandsons of[2] those who had fought under William, and the
great-grandsons of those who had fought under Harold, began to[3]
draw near to each other in friendship, and the first pledge of their
reconciliation was the[4] Great Charter, won[5] by their united
exertions, and framed for their common benefit. Here commences the
history of the English nation. The history of the preceding events[6]
is the history of wrongs inflicted[7] and sustained by various tribes,
which, indeed[8], all dwelt on English ground, but[9] which regarded
each other with aversion such as[10] has scarcely ever existed between
communities separated[11] by physical barriers.—MACAULAY, HISTORY OF
ENGLAND.

[1] +Die ‘Magna Charta’ ist der am 19ᵗᵉⁿ Juni 1215 dem König Johann ohne
Land abgerungene Staatsgrundvertrag, welcher als Grundlage der englischen
Verfassung gilt.+

[2] ‘of those — Harold’. These two clauses are best rendered in a
contracted form, thus: ‘of the men who had fought under W. and H.’

[3] to draw near to each other, +sich einander nähern+; in friendship,
+freundschaftlich+, adv.

[4] +die Magna Charta.+

[5] The two clauses containing the two p. ps. must be turned into one
contracted relative clause, as explained in S. 7, N. 3, _B._ Use the
verbs in the Impf. of the Passive Voice. To frame, +entwerfen+.

[6] +Ereignis+, n.

[7] The two p. ps. qualifying ‘wrongs’ (+Unbilden+) should be placed
before that noun, as explained in S. 7, N. 3, _A_; of, +von+; to
inflict, +verüben+; to sustain, +erleiden+; by — tribes, +verschiedener
Volksstämme+.

[8] +zwar+; on = upon; ground = soil.

[9] but — aversion = but (+jedoch+) showed such an aversion against
one another. =The Article=, when used in connection with adjectives
and adverbs, stands in German generally before those words: such
_an_ aversion, +~einen solchen~ Widerwillen+. Since the clause to be
translated is in reality but a part of the preceding relative clause,
which it completes, the verb must be placed?

[10] such as, +wie+, after which supply the pron. +er+, to give more
distinctness to the rendering; to exist, +bestehen+; communities =
nations.

[11] +welche durch natürliche Grenzen von einander getrennt sind.+




_Section 29._

HONESTY.


Mr.[1] Denham had been in business at Bristol, had failed[2], compounded,
and gone[3] to America. There[4], by a close application to business
as a merchant, he acquired a plentiful[5] fortune in _a_ few years.
Returned[6] to England, he invited his old creditors to an entertainment,
at which he thanked them for the easy[7] terms (S. 16, N. 10) they had
favoured[8] him with, and, though the guests had expected nothing but a
good treat, every[9] man, at the first remove, found to his astonishment
a cheque under his plate for[10] the full amount of the unpaid
remainder, with interest.—DR. B. FRANKLIN.

[1] ‘Mr. — Bristol’, translate ‘Mr. D. had had a business at (+in+) B.’,
and place the object after the adverbial circumstance of place.

[2] to fail (in business) +fallieren+; to compound, +accordieren+.
Verbs from the Latin with the termination +~ieren~+ do not admit of the
prefix or augment +~ge~+ in the Past Participle, but follow in all other
respects the weak or modern form of conjugation.

[3] Say ‘and was gone to America’. The verb +~gehen~+ is always construed
with +=sein=+, which auxiliary is especially =used with Intransitive
Verbs= denoting a Passive State of the subject, a change from one State
into another, or a Motion, if the place to which the motion is directed,
or from which it proceeds, is either expressed or understood.

[4] The words ‘he acquired’ (+erlangen+) should, in an inverted form
(App. § 14), follow the adverb ‘There’; ‘by — merchant’, +durch
unablässige kaufmännische Thätigkeit+.

[5] plentiful = great. For the position of the object see App. § 9.

[6] +Nach England zurückgekehrt+; entertainment = meal; at which, +wobei+.

[7] +bequem+; terms, +Bedingungen+.

[8] to favour a person with something, +einem etwas gewähren+ (v. tr.);
nothing but, +nur+; treat, +Schmaus+, m.

[9] every — plate, +fand doch ein jeder nach dem ersten Gange zu seinem
Erstaunen unter dem Teller einen Wechsel vor+.

[10] for — interest = which was issued (+ausstellen+) for (+auf+) the
full amount of the remaining (+rückständig+) debt with (+nebst+) interest.




_Section 30._

FORMATION OF A CORAL-ISLAND.

I.


It seems to me, that[1] when the animalcules, which form the corals at
the bottom[2] of the ocean, cease to live, their[3] structures adhere to
each other, by virtue either of the glutinous remains within, or of some
property in salt-water. The interstices being[4] gradually filled up with
sand and[5] broken pieces of coral washed by the sea, which also adhere,
a mass of rock is at length formed. Future[6] races of these animalcules
erect their habitations upon the rising[7] bank, and[8] die, in their
turn to elevate this monument of their wonderful labours.

[1] ‘that when the animalcules ... cease to live’. This clause may be
briefly rendered by saying: ‘that after the death (+Absterben+, n.) of
the animalcules’. To translate the last noun, form a diminutive of +Tier+.

[2] +Meeresboden+, m.

[3] ‘their — salt-water’. Use the following order of words for rendering
this passage: ‘their little houses (dim. of +Haus+) either through the in
them contained glutinous remains (+Überreste+) or through some (+irgend
eine+) property of the salt-water held together are (Pres. of the Passive
Voice)’.

[4] When the =Present Participle= is used to denote a =logical cause=
from which we may draw an inference, it must, by the help of the
conjunction ‘+=da=+’, be changed into a finite verb, i.e. one with a
personal termination, thus:—

    The interstices being _gradually filled up_ with sand, a mass
    of rock is at length formed.

    +Da nun die Zwischenräume allmählich mit Sand ~ausgefüllt
    werden~, so wird aus dem Ganzen endlich eine Felsenmasse
    gebildet.+

The tense in which the verb is to be used, must always be determined by
the context.

[5] and — sea, +und mit vom Meere herangespülten zerbröckelten Korallen+;
it is a matter of course that the verbs must follow this passage.

[6] The following generations.

[7] ‘to rise’, here +sich erheben+. Present Participles used
attributively are inflected like adjectives. Bank = reef.

[8] ‘and die — labours’, translate ‘and die to (S. 19, N. 7) contribute
also in their turn (+ihrerseits+) to the elevation (+Erhöhung+, f.) of
this monument of their admirable work (+Arbeit+, f.)’.




_Section 31._

FORMATION OF A CORAL-ISLAND.

II.


The[1] new bank is not long in being visited by sea-birds. Salt-plants[2]
take root upon it (S. 4, N. 5, _B_), and[3] a soil is being formed.
A cocoa-nut, or the[4] drupe of a pandanus is thrown on[5] shore.
Land-birds visit it[6] and deposit the seeds of shrubs and trees. Every
high tide, and still more[7] every gale, adds something to the bank.
The[8] form of an island is gradually assumed, and last of all[9] comes
man (S. 3, N. 2) to (S. 19, N. 7) take possession.—M. FLINDERS.

[1] The new coral-reef is (S. 2, N. 1) now soon visited by (+von+)
sea-birds.

[2] Sea-plants; to take = to strike.

[3] +und so bildet sich eine Erdschicht.+

[4] +die Frucht einer Panane. Die Panane+ (Pandanus) +ist eine Art Palme
und wird auch Pandang+ (m.) +oder Palmnußbaum genannt.+

[5] +an+, contracted with the def. art.

[6] it = the same, to agree with its antecedent ‘shore’; to deposit,
+zurück´lassen+; seeds, +Same+, m., used in the sing.

[7] still more = especially; adds — bank, +trägt etwas zur Vergrößerung
des Riffs bei+.

[8] The latter (+dieses+) gradually assumes (+an´nehmen+) the form of an
island. The adv. ‘gradually’ may be made emphatic; see App. § 14.

[9] +zuletzt+; ‘to — possession’ = to take possession of the same.




_Section 32._

REYNARD[1] CAUGHT.


A fox observed[2] some fowls at roost, and wished to[3] gain access to
them by smooth speeches. “I have charming news[4] to tell you,” he[5]
said. “The animals have concluded[6] an agreement of universal peace with
one another. Come down and celebrate[7] with me this decree[8].” An old
cock, who was well on his guard, looked[9] cautiously all around, and
the fox, perceiving (S. 16, N. 4) this, inquired[10] the reason. “I was
only observing[11] those two dogs which are coming this way[12],” replied
the cock. Reynard prepared[13] to set off. “What[14],” cried the cock,
“have not the animals concluded an agreement of universal peace?” “Yes,”
returned the fox, “but those dogs (S. 5, N. 2) perhaps have not yet[15]
heard of it (S. 4, N. 5, _B_).”—ANONYMOUS.

[1] +Der überlistete Reineke+ (or +Reinhard+).

[2] to observe = to see; at roost, +auf ihrer Stange sitzen+.

[3] to — speeches, +durch glatte Worte ihrer habhaft zu werden+.

[4] charming news = something pleasant. To render ‘you’ use the dat. of
the persnl. pron. of the 2nd pers. pl. For the construction see App. § 7.

[5] The words indicating the speaker, =after a quotation=, must be
rendered in an =inverted form= (see App. § 13).

[6] to conclude, +ab´schließen+, str. v. tr.; the agreement of universal
peace, +der allgemeine Friedensvertrag+; to come down, +herun´terkommen+;
supply the adv. +also+ between the verb and the separable particle.

[7] +feiern.+

[8] +Beschluß+, m.

[9] to look all around, +sich nach allen Seiten um´sehen+.

[10] to inquire the reason, +sich nach der Ursache erkundigen+.

[11] =I was observing= = I observed (+beobachten+). =Which are coming=
= which come. The English compound forms of the verb with the auxiliary
and the present participle, and of the verb ‘to do’ with the infinitive
(=I do come= = I come. =I did come= = I came), must be rendered by the
corresponding simple forms.

[12] +dieses Weges+.

[13] +sich zum Davonlaufen bereit machen.+

[14] +Wie+.

[15] ‘not yet’, here +noch nichts+.




_Section 33._

THE[1] MEANS OF CONVEYANCE IN THE TIME OF CHARLES II.

I.


Heavy articles[2] were (S. 2, N. 1) in the time of Charles II
generally conveyed from place to place by waggons[3]. The[4] expense
of transmitting them was[5] enormous. From London to[6] Birmingham the
charge was £7 a[7] ton, and from London to Exeter £12, which[8] is a
third more than was afterwards charged[9] on turnpike-roads, and fifteen
times more than is now demanded by[10] railway companies. Coal[11] was
seen only in districts where it was produced[12], or[13] to which it
could be carried by sea, and[14] was, indeed, always known in the South
of England by the name of sea-coal.

[1] +Die Beförderungsmittel zur Zeit Karls des Zweiten.+

[2] objects.

[3] +Lastwagen+, which place after ‘generally’.

[4] ‘The — them’, may be briefly rendered by the compound noun ‘Die
Transportkosten’. It may here be pointed out that the German language
lends itself more easily than any other living language to the formation
of =compound expressions=. Many advantages result from this adaptability
of the language to express in one single term which, otherwise, would
require a number of words; but the greatest of these advantages seems to
me to lie in the power it gives us to avoid the too frequent use of the
Genitive, a power which, if rightly wielded, will impart great vigour,
conciseness, and elegance to the student’s style of writing.

[5] were extraordinary high (+groß+).

[6] +nach+; ‘charge’, here +Fracht+, f.; ‘to be’, here +betragen+; £7,
+sieben ~Pfund~ Sterling+.

[7] =The def. art. is used in stating the price of goods=, when the
English use the indef. art.; as—

    +Dieser Kattun kostet fünfzig Pfennige ~die~ Elle.+

    This cotton is sixpence _a_ yard. (10 pfennigs = 1⅕_d._)

[8] The pron. ‘=which=’ referring to a whole clause, and not to a
particular word in that clause, should be rendered by the indef. rel.
pron. =was=; as—

    She acted without thinking about the consequences, _which_ was
    very wrong.

    +Sie handelte, ohne über die Folgen nachzudenken, ~was~ sehr
    unrecht war.+

[9] +berechnen+; turnpike-road, +Chaussee+, f.

[10] +von+, followed by the def. art.; to demand, +beanspruchen+.

[11] +Steinkohlen+, used in the pl. without the art. Use the active voice
with man, S. 4, N. 4.

[12] +gewinnen+.

[13] or — sea, +oder wohin sie verschifft werden konnten+.

[14] Say ‘and it was (+sie wurden+) in the South of England therefore
(+daher auch+) only called sea-coal (+Schiffskohlen+)’.




_Section 34._

THE[1] MEANS OF CONVEYANCE IN THE TIME OF CHARLES II.

II.


The rich[1] (S. 5, N. 2) commonly travelled in[2] their own iron
carriages with at least four horses. A[3] coach and six is in our time
never seen, except as part of some procession. The frequent mention,
therefore, of such equipages[4] in old books is likely to mislead us.
We[5] attribute to magnificence what was really[6] the effect of[7]
disagreeable necessity. People[8] in the time of Charles II travelled
with six horses, because[9] with a smaller number there was danger of
sticking[10] fast in the mire.—_Abridged from_ MACAULAY’S HISTORY OF
ENGLAND.

[1] =Adjectives used as nouns= are declined as they would be if the noun,
which is understood, were to follow them. They are always written with a
capital initial.

[2] +in ihren eigenen mit wenigstens vier Pferden bespannten eisernen
Kutschen.+

[3] ‘A — seen’. This clause must be construed thus: ‘Except (+Außer+) in
processions a coach and six (+eine sechsspännige Kutsche+, see App. § 14)
is now never seen’. Supply the words ‘+bei uns+’ before the p. p.

[4] +Staatsfuhrwerke+; therefore ... is likely to mislead us = can
therefore easily mislead (+irre führen+) us. The object ‘us’ must be
placed immediately after the copula ‘can’.

[5] +Wir schreiben der Prachtliebe zu.+

[6] really = in reality; ‘effect’, here = consequence.

[7] Say ‘of a’.

[8] One (S. 5, N. 2).

[9] because ... there was danger, +weil man ... Gefahr lief+; ‘small’,
here +gering+.

[10] to stick fast, +stecken bleiben+. Use the Supine, for: When the
=English Gerund= (i.e. the verbal in -ing) is governed by a noun, a verb,
or an adjective, it is generally rendered by the =Supine=. Comp. S. 78,
N. 14. Examples:

    He possesses the _gift of speaking_ well.

    +Er besitzt die Gabe gut ~zu sprechen~.+

    Do not begin _talking_!

    +Fangen Sie nicht an ~zu sprechen~!+

SIR[1] WILLIAM HERSCHEL.


When[2] pursuing his musical avocations in the pump-room at Bath, Sir
William Herschel had a small workshop close[3] at hand, and when (S. 18,
N. 6) the[4] exacting loungers in the pump-room admitted of a pause in
the music, he slipped off[5] to (S. 19, N. 7) complete the polishing of
a speculum[6], or the grinding[7] of a lens. Scarcely, however, had he
heard the signal[8], when[9] he was ready to snatch up his instrument
and[10] to be the first in the orchestra. Thus[11] he gathered up the
fragments of time, and this made (S. 27, N. 4) him at last the friend of
monarchs[12], and the first[13] of astronomers.—REV. DR. LEITCH.

[1] +~Friedrich Wilhelm Herschel~ (später =Sir William Herschel=)
wurde am 15ᵗᵉⁿ Nov. 1738 in Hannover geboren. Er kam als Musiker nach
England, beschäftigte sich jedoch in seinen Mußestunden eingehend mit
der Astronomie, welcher er sich endlich ganz widmete. Er entdeckte mit
selbst verfertigten Spiegelteleskopen von bis dahin unbekannter Größe
den Uranus, zwei Saturnsmonde, zahlreiche Doppelsterne, Sternhaufen
und Nebelflecken, und lieferte höchst wichtige Beobachtungen über
die Planeten. Diese Entdeckungen, welche der Welt durch die von der
königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften veröffentlichten Journale
mitgetheilt wurden, machten ihn bald zum berühmten Manne. Er wurde von
dem Könige Georg III zum königlichen Astronomen ernannt und genoß Ehre,
Ruhm und Wohlstand, als er am 25ˢᵗᵉⁿ Aug. 1822 zu Slough bei Windsor
starb. Es ist unmöglich, hier nicht auch zugleich seiner geliebten
Schwester ~Karoline~ zu gedenken, welche mit seltener Hingebung sich
den Bestrebungen und Arbeiten des älteren Bruders anschloß und so nicht
wenig zu den glänzenden Erfolgen dieses großen und höchst merkwürdigen
Mannes beitrug. Sie starb im Jahre 1848 in ihrer Vaterstadt Hannover.
Ihre unlängst veröffentlichten Memoiren und Briefe verdienen im höchsten
Grade das allgemeine Interesse, welches sie nicht allein in Deutschland,
sondern auch in England hervorgerufen haben.+

[2] This passage requires a different construction in German, thus: ‘When
Sir W. H. was still officiating (+fungie´ren+, see S. 32, N. 11) in the
pump-room (+Trinkhalle+) at Bath as _a_ member of the band (+Kapelle+),

_Section 36._

THE[1] AIR-OCEAN.

I.


Enveloping[2] this solid globe of ours are two oceans, one[3] partial,
and the other universal. _There is_ the[4] ocean of water, which has[5]
settled down into all _the_ depressions[6] of the earth’s surface[7],
leaving[8] dry above it all the high lands, as mountain-ranges,
continents, and islands; and[9] _there is_ an ocean of air, which
enwraps[10] the whole in one transparent mantle.

Through[11] the bosom of that ocean, like fishes with their fins (App. §
14), birds[12] and other winged creatures swim; whilst man[13] and other
mammalia creep like[14] crabs at the bottom of this aerial sea[15].

[1] +Das Luftmeer.+

[2] Say ‘Two oceans envelop (+umgeben+) our solid globe (+Erdkugel+).

[3] the one partial (+teilweise+) and the other universal (+ganz+). The
subsequent sentence is best introduced by a colon (:), which we use to
direct attention to what is following. The words ‘_There is_’ must then
be omitted.

[4] +das Weltmeer.+

[5] ‘which — all’, say ‘which fills (+erfüllen+) all’.

[6] +Vertiefung+, f.

[7] To render ‘of the earth’s surface’, form a compound noun by combining
the corresponding German terms of the nouns ‘earth’ and ‘surface’.

_A._ When the component parts of =Compound Nouns= are substantives, we
combine them often without any connecting link; as—+das Lasttier+, beast
of burden; +das Stadtviertel+, the quarter of a town, ward.

_B._ Neither do we require a connecting link for the formation of
=Compound Nouns= the first component of which is an adjective or a
particle; as—+die Großmutter+, grandmother; +das Unglück+, misfortune;
+der Urquell+, fountain-head.

_C._ The =Gender of Compound Nouns= (with the exception of a few
compounds with +Mut+, m.) is determined by the last component, which is
always a noun.

[8] ‘leaving — islands’. This passage may be rendered thus: ‘so that all
_the_ high lands (+Erhöhungen+), as (+wie+) mountain-ranges, etc. ...
rise dry above the same; to rise, +sich erheben+.

[9] +und das Luftmeer.+

[10] +umhül´len+; say ‘the whole globe’ (+Kugel+, f.); ‘in’, here +mit+.

[11] In this ocean of air.

[12] Since the four subsequent nouns in this passage represent a whole
class, the def. art. is required before each (S. 3, N. 2).

[13] Use this noun in the plural, since the noun with which it is
connected by the conj. ‘and’ stands in the same number.

[14] +gleich Krebsen+; to creep, +umher kriechen+. The word ‘whilst’
being a subordinative conj., the verb must be placed?

[15] +Luftmeer+.




_Section 37._

THE AIR-OCEAN.

II.


The air-ocean, which everywhere[1] surrounds the earth, and feeds and
maintains it, is even[2] more simple, more grand, and more majestic
than the[3] ‘world of waters’; more[4] varied and changeful in its
moods of storm and calm, of ebb and flow, of brightness and gloom.
The[5] atmosphere is, indeed, a wonderful thing, a most perfect example
of the economy of nature. Deprived of[6] air, no animal would live,
no plant _would_ grow, no flame _would_ burn, no[7] light _would_ be
diffused. The[8] air, too, is the sole medium of sound. Without it,
mountains might[9] fall, but[10] it would be in perfect silence. Neither
whisper[11] nor thunders[12] would[13] ever be heard.—MAURY, PHYSICAL
GEOGRAPHY OF THE SEA.

[1] Place the adverb before the verb.

[2] +sogar noch.+

[3] +jene mächtige Wasserwelt+, after which put a full stop and begin a
new sentence.

[4] This passage may be construed thus: ‘It offers a greater variety
(+Mannigfaltigkeit+) and changeableness in the transitions from storm
to (+zu+) calm, from ebb to flow, and from light to gloom (+Dunkel+,
n.)’. The article (which, if practicable, should be contracted with the
preceding preposition) must be used with the last six nouns, see S. 3, N.
2.

[5] +Der Luftkreis ist in der That höchst wunderbar und gewährt ein
vollendetes Beispiel von dem haushälterischen Wesen der Natur.+

[6] Without (App. § 14); would = could, Impf. Subj.

[7] +und kein Licht sich verbrei´ten.+

[8] Also (def. art.) sound can only be transmitted (+fort´pflanzen+)
through the air.

[9] might = could; to fall, +ein´stürzen+.

[10] Say ‘and yet the prevailing silence would not be interrupted’.

[11] +leises Geflüster+, acc.

[12] +lauten Donner+, acc.

[13] ‘would — heard’, use the active voice with the indef. pron. man.




_Section 38._

CHEERFUL[1] CHURCH-MUSIC.


When the poet Carpani inquired[2] of his friend Haydn[3] how it
happened[4] that his church-music was[5] always so cheerful, the great
composer made[6] _the_ following beautiful reply:

“I cannot make it otherwise[7],” said he, “I[8] write according to the
thoughts I feel. When[9] I think of God, my heart is so full of joy
that (App. § 16) the[10] notes dance and leap, as it were, from my pen;
and since God has given me a cheerful heart, it[11] will be pardoned me
that[12] I serve him with _a_ cheerful spirit.”—REV. R. K. ARVINE.

[1] +fröhlich.+

[2] inquired of = asked.

[3] +Joseph Haydn (geb. den 31ˢᵗᵉⁿ März 1732 zu Rohrau in Östreich, † den
31ˢᵗᵉⁿ Mai 1809 in Wien) bildete sich durch eigenes Studium in der Musik
aus und lebte dann namentlich als Kapellmeister des Fürsten Esterhazy in
Wien. Er ist der Schöpfer der Symphonie und des Streichquartetts; auch
hat er sich durch die Begründung der neueren Instrumentationskunst ein
besonderes Verdienst erworben. Seine Werke sind ebenso zahlreich, wie
mannigfaltig; durch die beiden Oratorien: ‘Die Schöpfung’ (1799) und ‘die
Jahreszeiten’ (1801) hat er jedoch seinen Namen mit ehernen Lettern in
die Geschichte der Kunst eingetragen.+

[4] Use the Pres. Subj. of +kommen+, since the clause contains an
indirect question; see App. §§ 28 and 30.

[5] was — cheerful, +stets einen so fröhlichen Charakter trage+.

[6] to make a reply, +eine Antwort geben+; ‘beautiful’, here +sinnig+;
for the construction see App. § 15.

[7] +anders+; for the place of the negation see App. § 12.

[8] Translate the passage ‘I write — feel’ briefly by saying: ‘I write
just as (+so wie+) I feel’, since it would not be in accordance with the
genius of the German language to render the sentence in a literal way.
(+~Gedanken~ kann man nicht ~fühlen~+.)

[9] +Denke ich an Gott, so ist+, etc.; full of, +voller+.

[10] Construe this clause after the following model:

    The notes danced and leapt, as it were, from _his_ pen.

    +Die Noten tanzten und hüpften ~ihm~ gleichsam aus ~der~ Feder.+

[11] +so wird man mir hoffentlich verzeihen.+

[12] that = if.




_Section 39._

OUR INDUSTRIAL[1] INDEPENDENCE DEPENDS UPON OURSELVES.


Truer[2] words were never uttered than those spoken by Mr. Dargan, the
Irish railway-contractor, at a public meeting in Dublin.

“I have[3] heard a great deal[4],” he said, “about the independence that
we are[5] to get from this or that source, yet[6] I have always been
deeply impressed with the conviction, that our industrial independence
depends upon ourselves. Simple[7] industry and careful exactness would[8]
be the making of Ireland. We have, it[9] is true, made a step in advance,
but perseverance is[10] indispensably necessary for eventual success.”—S.
SMILES.

[1] +industriell+.

[2] A greater truth than that which Mr. D., the Irish railway-contractor
(+Eisenbahn-Unternehmer+), spoke (+aus´sprechen+) at (+in+) a public
meeting in (+zu+) Dublin, has never been uttered.

[3] The words ‘he said’ should follow here; see S. 32, N. 5.

[4] a great deal = much.

[5] are to get, +erlangen sollen+; for the construction see App. § 16;
from, +aus+.

[6] yet I have always had the firm conviction. Render ‘to have’ here by
+hegen+.

[7] +schlicht+; ‘industry’, here +Fleiß+, m.; careful, +streng+;
exactness, +Pflichterfüllung+, f.

[8] would establish (+begründen+) Ireland’s prosperity (+Wohlstand+, m.).

[9] it is true, +zwar+; see S. 15, N. 3; ‘to make’, here +thun+; in
advance, +vorwärts+.

[10] Here follow the words ‘for (+zu+, contracted with the def. art.)
eventual (+eventuell+) success’.




_Section 40._

ENGLAND’S[1] TREES.


The principal native[2] trees are the[3] oak, ash, elm, poplar, aspen,
birch, larch, alder, hawthorn, hazel, and willow. The beech, maple,
horse-chestnut[4], Spanish chestnut[5], walnut[6], sycamore, acacia,
weeping willow, cedar, and Lombardy poplar have been introduced.

The moist climate of[7] England is[8] eminently suited to the growth
of[9] forest-trees, and we find that in ancient times the larger part
of the country presented one[10] vast scene of forest, as[11] the[12]
uncleared districts of America do now. The[13] few scattered patches of
natural wood which remain, show[14] what was once the character of nearly
the whole country.—HEWITT, PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF ENGLAND AND WALES.

[1] See S. 14, N. 3.

[2] +einheimisch.+

[3] +die Eiche.+ The article is repeated in this passage only when the
subsequent noun is of different gender or number from the preceding one.

[4] +die Roßkastanie.+

[5] +die echte Kastanie.+

[6] +der Wallnußbaum.+

[7] +Englands.+

[8] to be suited to a thing, +~einer~ Sache zu´träglich sein+; eminently,
+außerordentlich+, which place before ‘+zuträglich+’.

[9] Use the gen. of the def. art. =The definite article= should be used
in all cases where an object is individualised or singled out from other
objects.

[10] one — forest = an almost uninterrupted scene of forest,
+Waldlandschaft+, f.

[11] as ... do now, +wie noch jetzt+.

[12] +die ungelichteten Waldgegenden.+

[13] The — remain, +Die wenigen zerstreut liegenden Überreste natürlicher

[14] Say ‘show the character which formerly belonged almost to the whole
country’.




_Section 41._

THE INDIAN CHIEF[1].

I.


During the war in America, a company[2] _of_ Indians attacked a small
body[3] of British troops[4], and defeated[5] them. As[6] the Indians
had[7] greatly the advantage in swiftness of foot, and were eager in the
pursuit, very few of the English escaped; and those who[8] fell into
their hands, were treated with a cruelty of which there[9] are not many
examples, even in that country.

Two of the Indians came up[10] to a young officer, and attacked him with
great fury. As[6] they were armed with battle-axes, he had no hope
of[11] escape. But, just at[12] this crisis, another Indian came up[13],
who was advanced in years, and was armed with a bow and arrows. The[14]
old man instantly drew his bow; but, after[15] having taken his aim at
the officer, he suddenly dropped his arrow, and[16] interposed between
the young soldier and his pursuers, who were about[17] to cut him to
pieces. The two Indians retired with respect.

[1] +Der Indianerhäuptling.+

[2] +Haufe+, m.

[3] +Schar+, f.

[4] troops = soldiers.

[5] to defeat, +in die Flucht schlagen+.

[6] When the conjunction ‘=as=’ stands for ‘=since=’, it must be rendered
by ‘+=da=+’.

[7] had — foot, +den Britten im Laufen bedeutend überlegen waren+; and
— pursuit = and eagerly pursued the same. For the following clause
see S. 27, N. 8, and say ‘only few of the Britons succeeded to escape
(+davon´kommen+)’. I succeed, +es gelingt mir+.

[8] +welche den Indianern in die Hände fielen.+

[9] there are, +es giebt+. The subject ‘+es+’, which must be placed
immediately after the relative pronoun, should be followed by the
adverbial clause ‘even in that country’.

[10] to come up to a person, +sich einem nähern+.

[11] +auf Rettung.+

[12] at = in; crisis = critical (+entscheidungsvoll+) moment.

[13] to come up = to appear; who — arrows = of advanced
(+vorgeschritten+) age and armed with bow and arrows.

[14] +der Alte+; to draw, +spannen+; immediately, +unverzüglich+, which
may be emphasized by being placed at the head of the clause (App. § 14).

[15] Say ‘after he had aimed (+zielen+) at (+auf+) the officer’; to drop,
+fallen lassen+.

[16] and interposed, +und stellte sich+.

[17] to be about, +im Begriff sein+; to cut to pieces, +zerstückeln+;
with respect = respectfully.




_Section 42._

THE INDIAN CHIEF.

II.


The[1] old man then took the officer by the hand, soothed him into
confidence by caresses, and, having conducted him to his hut, treated
him with a kindness which did honour to his professions[2]. He made (S.
27, N. 4) him less a[3] slave than a[3] companion, taught[4] him the
language of the country, and instructed him in[5] the rude arts that
were practised by the inhabitants. They[6] lived together in _the_ most
perfect harmony, and the young officer, in[7] the treatment he met with,
found nothing to regret, but[8] that (App. § 16) sometimes the old man
fixed his eyes upon him, regarded[9] him for some minutes with steady and
silent attention, and then burst into tears.

[1] Say ‘Hereupon the old man seized the hand of the officer, sought by
caresses to gain his (+dessen+) confidence, conducted him to (+in+) his
hut, and treated’, etc.

[2] +Versprechung+, f.

[3] his.

[4] The verb +=lehren=+, to teach (old German lêran, Gothic laisjan),
etymologically signifies ‘to cause a person to know a thing’. This is the
reason that it is in German most generally used with two accusatives:
that of the person and that of the thing; as—+Er lehrt mich ~die
Landessprache~+, he teaches me the language of the country. +Lehre ~mich
Deine Rechte~!+ (Luther.) +Wer hat ~dich solche Streiche~ gelehrt?+
(Uhland.)

[5] in — arts, +in den geringen Geschicklichkeiten+; to practise, +üben+;
by, +von+; ‘inhabitants’, here +Eingebornen+.

[6] They = both; together = with one another, which place after ‘harmony’
(+Eintracht+, f.).

[7] in — with, +in der ihm zuteil werdenden Behandlung+. Where must the
verb be placed? Supply the word ‘+anderes+’ after ‘nothing’; ‘to regret’,
here +beklagen+.

[8] +als.+

[9] Say ‘regarded him silently _for_ a while (App. § 9, _A_) with steady
(+unverwandt+) attention’.




_Section 43._

THE INDIAN CHIEF.

III.


In[1] the meantime the spring returned, and the Indians again took the
field. The old man, who was still vigorous, and able to bear the fatigues
of war[2], set out with them, _and was_ accompanied by his prisoner.
They marched above[3] two hundred leagues across the forests, and came
at length to[4] a plain, where the British forces[5] were encamped. The
old man showed his prisoner the tents at a distance[6]: “There,” said
he, “are thy countrymen. There is the enemy who[7] waits to give us
battle. Remember[8] that I have saved thy[9] life, that I have taught[10]
thee to conduct a canoe, to arm thyself with[11] bow and arrows, and to
surprise[12] the beaver in the forest. What wast thou when I first took
thee to my hut? Thy hands were those of an infant. They could neither
procure[13] thee sustenance nor safety. Thy soul was[14] in utter
darkness. Thou wast ignorant of everything. Thou owest all things to
me. Wilt thou, then[15], go over to thy nation, and take up the hatchet
against us?”

[1] Say ‘Meanwhile it became spring’; to take the field, +ins Feld
ziehen+.

[2] +die Kriegsbeschwerden+; ‘to set out’, here +ziehen+.

[3] more than.

[4] to = into.

[5] forces = troops; to encamp, +sein Lager auf´schlagen+.

[6] +von weitem+, which place before the accusative.

[7] who waits, +der darauf lauert+; to give battle = to attack.

[8] +Bedenke.+

[9] _A._ =The definite article= is often used =instead of the possessive
adjective pronoun= in cases where the possessor is clearly seen from the
context; as—

    +Ich habe die Feder in ~der~ Hand.+

    I have the pen in _my_ hand.

_B._ =The possessor is often indicated by a personal pronoun in the
dative case=; as—

    +Ich will ~mir die~ Hände waschen.+

    I will wash _my_ hands.

The latter mode of construction must be applied in this case.

[10] ‘I have taught thee to conduct a canoe.’ Read once more S. 42, N. 4,
and mark further that: =that which is taught is often expressed in the
form of a Supine=, as in this instance.

[11] We say ‘+mit Pfeil und Bogen+’.

[12] +überfal´len+.

[13] +gewäh´ren+; sustenance, +Nahrung+, f.

[14] +lag in Finsternis gehüllt.+

[15] +also+; nation = people; to take up = to seize.




_Section 44._

THE INDIAN CHIEF.

IV.


The officer replied that[1] he would rather lose his own life than take
away that of his deliverer. The Indian, bending[2] down his (S. 43, N. 9,
_A_) head, _and_ covering his face with both _his_ hands, stood[3] some
time silent. Then, looking[4] earnestly at his prisoner, he[5] said, in
a voice that was at once softened by tenderness and grief: “Hast thou a
father?” “My father,” said the young man, “was[6] alive when I left my
country[7].” “Alas!” said[8] the Indian, “how wretched[9] must he be!” He
paused[10] a moment, and then added: “Dost thou know that[11] I have been
a father? I[12] am a father no more. I saw my son fall in[13] battle. He
fought at my side. I saw him expire. He was covered with wounds, when he
fell[14] dead at my feet.”

[1] that — deliverer = that he would rather die than kill his deliverer.
See App. §§ 28 and 30.

[2] The two Participles in -ing are best rendered by using the Imperfect.

[3] stood — silent, +und stand so eine Weile schweigend da+.

[4] Say ‘Upon this (+Hierauf+) he looked’, etc.

[5] he — grief, +und fragte mit von Zärtlichkeit und Kummer gedämpfter
Stimme+.

[6] +war noch am Leben.+

[7] +Heimat+, f.

[8] exclaimed.

[9] unhappy.

[10] +zögern+, i.e. to hesitate.

[11] +daß auch ich einst Vater war?+

[12] Say ‘But now I (App. § 14) am it no more’.

[13] We use here the def. art.

[14] +nie´derfallen.+




_Section 45._

THE INDIAN CHIEF.

V.


He pronounced[1] these words with the utmost vehemence. His[2] body shook
with a universal tremour. He[3] was almost stifled with sighs, which[4]
he would not suffer to escape him. There[5] was a keen restlessness in
the eye, but no tears flowed to[6] his relief. At[7] length he became
calm by degrees: and, turning towards the east, where the sun had just
risen, “Dost thou see,” said he to the young officer, “the beauty of
that sky, which sparkles with prevailing day? and hast thou pleasure in
the sight?” “Yes,” replied the[8] young officer, “I have pleasure in the
beauty of[9] so fine a sky.” “I have none!” said the Indian, and[10] his
tears then found their way.

A few minutes after, he showed the young man a[11] magnolia, in full
bloom. “Dost thou see that beautiful tree?” said he, “and dost thou
look[12] upon it with pleasure?” “Yes,” replied the officer, “I[13] look
with pleasure upon that beautiful tree.” “I have no longer any pleasure
in[14] looking upon it!” said the Indian hastily[15], and[16] immediately
added: “Go, return to thy father, that[17] he may still have pleasure,
when (S. 18, N. 6) he sees the sun rise in[18] the morning, and the trees
blossom in the spring!”—WASHINGTON IRVING.

[1] spoke. Begin the clause with ‘These words’ (S. 7, N. 2).

[2] Say ‘A universal tremour shook (+erschüttern+) his body’.

[3] +Er erstickte fast unter den Seufzern.+

[4] Say ‘which he endeavoured (+bemüht sein+) to suppress’.

[5] His eyes (sing.) looked restlessly about.

[6] +zur Linderung seines Schmerzes.+

[7] Say ‘Gradually he became calmer’. The following passage requires
altogether a different structure in German. Say ‘He turned towards the
east (+sich gen Osten wenden+), where the sun had just risen. “Dost thou
see the beauty of the sky, which sparkles (+erglänzen+) with (+von+) the
breaking (+an´brechen+) day (+Tageslicht+, n.)? and hast thou pleasure
(+Freude+, f.) in (+an+) the sight (+Anblick+, m.)?” he asked the young
officer’.

[8] the — officer, +dieser+, to avoid a useless repetition.

[9] of such a (S. 28, N. 9) sky.

[10] ‘and his’, say ‘whose’; found their way, +hervor´brachen+.

[11] +eine in voller Blüte stehende Magnolie.+

[12] ‘to look upon’, here +betrachten+.

[13] Say ‘I rejoice in its splendour’, to avoid monotony. To rejoice in a
thing, +sich einer Sache freuen+.

[14] ‘in — it’, may be briefly rendered by ‘in the sight’.

[15] +rasch.+

[16] ‘and — Go’. Begin a new clause here, and say: ‘“Go,” he added
(+fügte er dann hinzu+)’.

[17] +auf daß+ (followed by the Pres. Subj. of +haben+).

[18] +des Morgens+, App. § 9. The verb ‘sees’, being the governing verb
in both clauses, takes the last place. See App. § 19.




_Section 46._

RICE.


Rice forms the[1] chief subsistance of the people[2] in India, China,
Japan, and other eastern[3] countries. Indeed, it supports[4] more
persons than any other article of food[5]. In Asia it (S. 2, N. 1)
is chiefly cultivated in India, China, and[6] Ceylon; in Europe: in
Lombardy[7] (Italy) and Spain; in Africa: in Egypt; in South America:
in Brazil; and in North America: in[8] the Carolines and[9] Louisiana.
Its[10] cultivation requires an[11] immense quantity of moisture. It[12]
grows best in[13] fields which can be inundated. Indeed[14], the fact
that it is usually sown upon watery soil makes it probable that the
first Verse of the eleventh Chapter in[15] Ecclesiastes refers to Rice.
In Egypt, for example, it is always sown while[16] the waters of the
Nile cover the land, and when the floods subside[17], (S. 27, N. 8) it
is deposited[18] in the mud. A strong spirit[19], called arrack, is
distilled from[20] rice, and[21] the straw is used for making plait for
hats and bonnets.—NELSON’S READERS.

[10] +Der Reisbau+, i.e. the cultivation of rice.

THE WHITE SHIP.

(A.D. 1120.)

I.


King Henry I went[1] over to Normandy with his son Prince (S. 10, N. 2)
William and a great retinue, to have the prince acknowledged[2] as his
successor by the Norman nobles, and to contract[3] the promised marriage
between him and the daughter of the count of Anjou. When both[4] these
things had been done with great show[5] and rejoicing, the whole retinue
prepared[6] _to embark_ for the voyage home.

When[7] all was ready, _there_ came to the king Fitz-Stephen[8], a
sea-captain, and said: “My[9] liege, my father served your father all
his life, upon the sea. He steered[10] the ship[11] with the gold boy
upon the prow, in[12] which your father sailed[13] to conquer England.
I beseech you to grant[14] me the same office. I[15] have a fair vessel
in the harbour here, called the White Ship, manned by fifty sailors of
renown. I pray you, Sire[16], to[17] let your servant have the honour of
steering[18] you in the White Ship to England.”

[1] to go over, +sich begeben+. The words ‘to Normandy’ (S. 19, N. 4)
must be placed after ‘retinue’.

[2] to have acknowledged, +huldigen lassen+. See S. 19, N. 7. The words
‘by (+von+) the Norman nobles’ must be placed after ‘prince’. The nobles,
+der Adel+.

[3] to contract a promised marriage, +einen verabredeten Heiratsvertrag
ab´schließen+. The pron. ‘him’ should be turned by ‘the prince’, to avoid
ambiguity.

[4] both — things = this.

[5] +Pomp+, m.; rejoicing, +viele Freudenbezeigungen+; to be done,
+geschehen+.

[6] +sich zur Heimreise an´schicken.+

[7] Supply the adverb ‘+nun+’ after ‘when’.

[8] The subject and apposition must be placed immediately after the
predicate. Comp. App. § 15.

[9] Say ‘My father, O prince (+Fürst+), served yours (use the second
pers. sing. of the posses. pron., and continue the address in the same
person) his whole life long at (+zur+) sea’.

[10] +lenken.+

[11] +das am Vorderteile mit einem goldenen Knaben verzierte Schiff.+

[12] +auf.+

[13] sailed — England = sailed (+sich ein´schiffen+) for (+zu+) the
conquest of England.

[14] +verleihen.+

[15] Say ‘I possess in this (+hiesig+) harbour a fair with fifty renowned
(+bewährt+) sailors (+Seeleute+) manned vessel (+Fahrzeug+), called (App.
§ 1) the White Ship’. Comp. S. 7, N. 3.

[16] +o Herr.+

[17] to let ... have = to grant; use the Supine.

[18] ‘to steer’, here = to conduct, +geleiten+. See S. 1, N. 3.




_Section 48._

THE WHITE SHIP.

II.


“I am sorry,” replied the king, “that[1] my vessel is already chosen, and
_that_ I cannot therefore sail with the son of the man who served[2] my
father. But[3] the prince, with all his company, shall go along with you
in the fair White Ship manned by fifty sailors of renown.”

An[4] hour or two afterwards, the king (App. § 15) set sail[5] in[6] the
vessel he had chosen, accompanied by other vessels, and[7], sailing all
night with a fair and gentle wind, arrived upon the coast of England in
the morning. While[8] it was yet night, the[9] people in some of the
ships heard a faint wild cry come[10] over the sea, and wondered what[11]
it was.

[1] Say ‘that I have already chartered (+bedingen+) a ship’.

[2] Use the =Perfect=, which is used in German to express an action or
occurrence both perfect and past, without reference to any other action
or occurrence.

[3] Render ‘but’ by +jedoch+, which place after ‘shall’; with — company,
+samt seinem ganzen Gefolge+; ‘to go along’, here +fahren+, to be placed
at the end of the whole clause, which construe accord. to S. 48, N. 6.

[4] An — afterwards = Soon after.

[5] to set sail, +ab´segeln+.

[6] =To place the qualifying parts before the word qualified is one of
the most striking peculiarities of German Grammar.= This construction,
called =attributive constriction=, has been explained in section 7, Note
3 with respect to the rendering of the Perfect (or Past) Participle
qualifying a preceding noun; but it must here be pointed out that it
may likewise be used for rendering the Present Participle qualifying
a preceding noun (comp. S. 16, N. 4), and that it is sometimes even
suitable for translating short relative clauses. This, as long as it is
not too much indulged in, imparts to the construction great conciseness
and vigour, and avoids the too frequent use of relative pronouns, which,
contrary to English construction, cannot be omitted in German. (Comp. S.
16, N. 10.)


EXAMPLES.

    When the fleet, _favoured_ by the finest weather, was about to
    set sail, there arose a shout of joy, _proceeding_ from many
    thousands of voices, and resounding mightily from the shore.

    +~Als die von dem schönsten Wetter begünstigte Flotte~ im
    Begriff war abzusegeln, erhob sich ~ein von vielen tausend
    Stimmen erschallender Jubelruf~, von dem das Ufer mächtig
    wiederhallte.+

    The child, gently _sleeping_ in his mother’s arms, was suddenly
    roused by his father’s noisy entrance.

    +~Das in den Armen der Mutter sanft schlafende Kind~ wurde
    plötzlich durch den lärmenden Eintritt des Vaters aufgeweckt.+

    The church, _which was damaged by the siege_, is now being
    restored.

    +~Die durch die Belagerung beschädigte Kirche~ wird jetzt
    wiederhergestellt.+

The clause ‘in — vessels’ requires the attributive construction, since
the two relative clauses, otherwise required, would make the rendering
very lengthy and monotonous. To avoid a useless repetition, translate the
first noun ‘vessel’ by +Schiff+ and the second by +Fahrzeug+, and connect
the two clauses by the conjunction +und+.

[7] The passage ‘and — morning’ may be briefly rendered thus: and
arrived, favoured (+begünstigt+, App. § 1) by a gentle (+mäßig+) wind,
the (+am+) next morning in England.

[8] Say ‘During the night’.

[9] the people = one, after which supply the conj. +jedoch+; in ships =
upon some ships.

[10] come — sea, +von der See herüber+, which place after ‘ships’; wild
cry, +Angstschrei+.

[11] +was dies zu bedeuten habe.+




_Section 49._

THE WHITE SHIP.

III.


The prince went[1] aboard the White Ship with _one_ hundred and forty
youthful nobles, among whom were eighteen noble ladies of the highest
rank. All[2] this gay company, with their servants and the fifty sailors,
made three hundred souls aboard the White Ship.

“Give three[3] casks _of_ wine, Fitz-Stephen,” said the prince, “to the
fifty sailors of renown. My[4] father the king has sailed out of the
harbour. What[5] time is there to make merry here, and yet reach England
with the rest?”

“Prince[6],” said Fitz-Stephen, “before morning my fifty and the White
Ship shall overtake the swiftest vessel in attendance on your father the
king, if we sail at midnight.”

[1] to go aboard ship, +sich auf ein Schiff begeben+; the young noble,
+der junge Adelige+; ‘to be’, here +sich befinden+; eighteen — rank,
+achtzehn dem höchsten Range angehörige Damen+. The words ‘aboard the
White Ship’ take the last place in the clause.

[2] This clause requires the following construction: With the servants
(+Dienerschaft+, f.) and the fifty sailors consisted the whole gay
company upon the White Ship of (+aus+) three hundred persons.

[3] Construe according to App. § 5.

[4] Say ‘My royal father’; has sailed out of = has left. Supply the
adverb +soeben+ after the auxiliary. This will greatly improve the
rendering.

[5] Also the two following passages require a different construction;
say ‘How long can we still make merry (+sich gütlich thun+) here (to be
placed before ‘still’), if we will arrive in England at the same time
(+zugleich+) with the others?’ The words ‘in England’ should stand before
the verbs, which arrange according to App. § 18.

[6] Say ‘“If we sail at (+um+) midnight, O prince (see S. 27, N. 8), my
fifty men (+Leute+) and the White Ship shall nevertheless (+dennoch+)
before the coming morning overtake the swiftest ship in the service of
thy royal father,” replied Fitz-Stephen’.—‘The swiftest — father’ = the
swiftest in the service of thy royal father standing ship. (Comp. S. 48,
N. 6.)




_Section 50._

THE WHITE SHIP.

IV.


Then[1] the prince commanded to[2] make merry; and the sailors drank
_out_ the three casks _of_ wine, and the prince and[3] all the noble[4]
company danced in the moonlight on the deck of the White Ship.

When at last she[5] shot[6] out of the harbour of Barfleur, there[7] was
not[8] a sober seaman on[9] board. But the sails were all set[10] and[11]
the oars all going merrily, Fitz-Stephen at the helm.

The gay young nobles and the beautiful ladies talked, laughed, and sang.
The prince encouraged[12] the fifty sailors to row harder[13] yet,
for[14] the honour of the White Ship.

[1] Hereupon.

[2] that they (+man+) should make merry. The verb must stand in the
Present Subjunctive, as will be seen from §§ 28-30 of the App.

[3] +samt.+

[4] +adelig+; company = retinue.

[5] +dieses+, to be placed after ‘When’.

[6] shot out of = left.

[7] there to be, +sich befinden+.

[8] not a, +auch nicht ein einziger+.

[9] Say ‘upon the ship’.

[10] +gespannt.+

[11] Say ‘and the oars moved (+sich bewegen+) merrily (+lustig+), whilst
F.-St. stood at the helm’.

[12] +an´treiben.+

[13] harder = faster.

[14] +dem weißen Schiff zu Ehren.+




_Section 51._

THE WHITE SHIP.

V.


Crash[1]!—a terrific cry broke from three hundred hearts. It was the
cry (S. 16, N. 10) the people[2] in the distant vessels of the king had
faintly[3] heard on the water. The White Ship had struck upon a rock,
and[4] was going down!

Fitz-Stephen hurried[5] the prince into a boat with some few nobles.
“Push off,” he whispered, “and row to[6] the land. It is not far, and the
sea is smooth[7]. The[8] rest of us must die.”

But[9], as they rowed away fast from the sinking ship, the prince heard
the voice of his sister Mary calling[10] for help. He (S. 5, N. 2) never
in his life had been so good as[11] he was then. He[12] cried, in an
agony: “Row back at any risk! I cannot bear[13] to leave her!”

[1] +Krach!—es erhob sich ein aus drei hundert Kehlen erschallender
fürchterlicher Angstschrei.+

[2] the people = one; in = upon.

[3] faintly on the water, +unvollkommen von der See herüber+.

[4] +und war im Sinken begriffen!+

[5] to hurry into a boat, +schnell in ein Boot steigen lassen+; with =
and.

[6] +an+, contracted with the def. art.

[7] +ruhig.+

[8] The — us = We others.

[9] Render ‘but’ by +jedoch+, which place before the adverb ‘fast’
(+schnell+); to row away, +sich entfernen+.

[10] See S. 16, N. 4; for, +um+.

[11] Say ‘as at (+in+) this moment’.

[12] The remaining passage will greatly improve by placing the clause
‘Row — risk’ before the words ‘He — agony’. In an agony, +voll
Seelenangst+; at any risk, +koste es, was es wolle+.

[13] When there is in a principal clause a transitive verb, the object
of which is contained in a following objective clause, which often
assumes the form of a supine (i.e. an infinitive with +zu+, see S. 1, N.
2), =the object in the principal clause is frequently supplied by the
pronoun +es+, which then may be called the grammatical object.= This is
more particularly the case when special emphasis is given to the verb
contained in the principal clause; as—

    He _liked to hear_ good music.

    +Er ~liebte es~, gute Musik ~zu hören~.+

    The deed proves, that she speaks the truth.

    +Die That ~beweist es~, daß sie die Wahrheit spricht.+




_Section 52._

THE WHITE SHIP.

They rowed back. When[1] the prince held out his arms to catch[2] his
sister, such[3] numbers lept in, that the boat was overset; and in the
same instant the White Ship went[4] down.

Only two men floated[5]: a nobleman, Godfrey by name, and a poor butcher
of Rouen. By and by[6] another man came swimming towards them, whom[7]
they knew, when he had pushed aside his long wet hair, to be Fitz-Stephen.

When he heard that the prince and all his retinue had[8] gone down,
Fitz-Stephen, with a ghastly face[9], cried: “Woe, woe to me!” and
sank[10] to the bottom.

[1] Supply here the conj. +aber+.

[2] +auf´fangen.+

[3] Say ‘so many persons jumped into the boat, that it capsized’.

[4] Supply the adverb +auch+ after the verb.

[5] to float, +auf dem Wasser schwimmen+; of Rouen, +aus Rouen+.

[6] +Kurz darauf+; supply the adverb +noch+ before ‘another’. He comes
swimming towards me, +er kommt auf mich zu´geschwommen+.

[7] Say ‘in whom they recognised Fitz-Stephen, when he’, etc.; to push
aside = to throw back.

[8] had gone down, +den Tod erlitten+. The auxiliary verb (had) may here
be omitted, for: =In subordinate clauses, the auxiliary verbs= (+haben+,
+sein+, and +werden+) =are often omitted for the sake of conciseness and
elegance=; as—

    +Daß sie mir ~genommen~ (wurde), ist mein größtes Leid.+

    That she _was_ taken from me is my greatest sorrow.

[9] with — face, +totenbleich+, adv. How must the words be arranged here?

[10] to sink to the bottom, +in die Tiefe hinab´sinken+. Supply the adv.
+dann+ after the verb, which will establish a closer connection between
this clause and the preceding one.




_Section 53._

THE WHITE SHIP.

VII.


The other two clung[1] to the yard for some hours. At length (App. § 14)
the young noble said faintly[2]: “I am exhausted, _and_ benumbed[3] with
cold, and can hold[4] no longer. Farewell, good friend. God preserve
(App. § 34) you!”

So[5] he dropped and sank, and of all the brilliant crowd[6], the poor
butcher of Rouen alone was saved. In[7] the morning, some fishermen
saw him floating in his sheep-skin coat[8], and got[9] him into their
boat,—the sole relater of the dismal tale.

For[1] three days no one dared to carry[10] the intelligence to the
king; at length they[11] sent into his presence a little boy, who,
weeping[12] bitterly, and kneeling at his feet, told him that the White
Ship was[13] lost, with all on board.

The king fell to the ground like[14] a dead man, and[15] never afterwards
was seen to smile.—C. DICKENS, A CHILD’S HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

[1] to cling to the yard, +sich an eine Segelstange an´klammern+; for
some hours, +einige Stunden lang+, for three days, +drei Tage lang+.

[2] +kraftlos.+

[3] +vor Kälte erstarrt.+

[4] ‘to hold,’ here +sich halten+.

[5] Say ‘Upon this (Hereupon) he fell into the water and sank to the
bottom (+in die Tiefe hinab´sinken+)’.

[6] crowd = company.

[7] In the morning, +am Morgen+.

[8] sheep-skin coat, +Schafpelz+, m.

[9] +nehmen+; the appositional clause ‘the sole relater (+Überbringer+)
of the dismal (+traurig+) tale (+Kunde+)’ must be placed immediately
after the pronoun ‘him’, to which it belongs; and mark that: =The
apposition must always agree in number, gender, and case with the noun or
pronoun to which it belongs.=

[10] to carry an intelligence to a person, +Einem eine Botschaft
verkünden+. See App. § 5.

[11] +man+; into his presence = to (+zu+) him, which place after ‘boy’.

[12] =The Present Participle may be used adverbially, as in English, to
denote manner or state.= Say ‘who told him kneeling and weeping bitterly,
that’, etc.

[13] was — board, +mit Mann und Maus gesunken sei+.

[14] like — man = as if dead (+wie tot+), which place after ‘fell.’

[15] Say ‘and never has one seen him smile again’.




_Section 54._

BARLEY (S. 3, N. 2).


Barley is (S. 2, N. 1) now principally used[6] to make[1] malt for[2]
brewing beer and distilling spirits. It serves, however[3], as food[4]
in _the_ form of pearl barley, used[5] for thickening soups. It is also
used[6] as food for poultry. Barley[7] meal is used for fattening pigs
and turkeys. Barley straw furnishes us fodder[8] for cattle and horses.
Barley is chiefly produced[9] in the northern regions of Europe, in
Central Asia, and in North America. It is much hardier[10] than wheat,
resists[11] _both_ heat and drought better, and[12] may therefore be
raised from poorer soils. It[13] is said to be the most ancient food[4]
of (S. 3, N. 2) man.—NELSON’S READERS.

[1] +bereiten+, see S. 19, N. 7.

[2] for — spirits, +zur Bierbrauerei und Branntweinbrennerei+, after
which supply +daraus+.

[3] +indessen+.

[4] +Nahrungsmittel+, n.

[5] Say ‘which one uses for thickening soups’, +zur Verdickung der
Suppen+.

[6] +benutzen+ and +gebrauchen+, which use alternately; as — poultry,
+als Hühnerfutter+.

[7] Say ‘With barley meal one fattens (+mästen+) pigs and turkeys
(+türkische Hühner+)’.

[8] +Vieh- und Pferdefutter+.

[9] +gebaut+. Where must the p. p. be placed here?

[10] +kräftig+.

[11] ‘to resist’ here = to bear, +vertragen+. Use the def. art. before
the first noun.

[12] Say ‘and can therefore be cultivated (+an´bauen+) upon poorer soil’.
Supply the adverb +auch+ after ‘therefore’.

[13] It is said to be, +sie soll ... sein+. =The verb +sollen+ is
frequently used to express an assertion of another person, when it
answers to the English ‘it is said’, ‘it is reported’, ‘they say’.=




_Section 55._

THE SOLDIER AND HIS FLAG (+Fahne+).


On seeing[1] a young Prussian soldier who was pressing his flag to
his bosom in the agonies of death, Napoleon said to his officers:
“Gentlemen[2], you see that a soldier has for his flag a sentiment almost
approaching[3] idolatry. Render[4] funeral honours at once to this young
man. I regret that I do not know his name, that[5] I might write to his
family. Do not take[6] _away_ his flag; its silken folds will be an
honourable shroud[7] for him.”—GENERAL BOURRIENNE[8].

[1] When =the Present Participle= is used =in adverbial clauses of
time=, it must generally, by the help of one of the conjunctions +als+
(when), +nachdem+ (after), +indem+ (while, whilst), and +während+
(while, whilst), be changed into a finite verb, i.e. one with a personal
termination; thus—

    _Hearing_ his opponent speak in this way, his features assumed
    an expression of contempt.

    +~Als~ er seinen Gegner so sprechen ~hörte~, nahmen seine Züge
    den Ausdruck der Verachtung an.+

    _Having given_ his orders, the officer rode quickly away.

    +~Nachdem er~ seine Befehle erteilt ~hatte~, ritt der Offizier
    schnell von dannen.+

    _Looking_ at me in a suppliant manner, a tear glittered in her
    eye.

    +~Indem sie~ mich bittend ~ansah~, glänzte eine Thräne in ihrem
    Auge.+

    I saw it _when passing_ the house this morning.

    +Ich sah es, ~als ich~ heute Morgen beim Hause ~vorüberging~.+

Consequently, the above passage must be rendered thus: ‘When Napoleon
saw (+bemerken+) a young Prussian soldier who was pressing his flag to
(+an+) his (S. 43, N. 9, _A_) bosom (+Herz+) in the agonies of death (+im
Todeskampfe+, which place after ‘flag’), he said to his officers’: etc.

[2] Say ‘You see, gentlemen’.

[3] ‘to approach’ here = to border (+an etwas grenzen+). For the
construction see S. 16, N. 4.

[4] Say ‘Bury this young man (+Jüngling+) without delay with military
honours’.

[5] that — write, +um ... schreiben zu können+. He writes _to_ me once a
month, +Er schreibt einmal monatlich ~an~ mich+.

[6] Supply the pronoun +ihm+ (from him) after the Imperative.

[7] +Leichentuch+, n.; ‘for him’ must be rendered by the dat. of the
pers. pron., which place after the copula ‘will’.

[8] +Der General Bourrienne war Privatsekretär und späterer Biograph
Napoleons des Ersten.+




_Section 56._

OUR CULTIVATED[1] NATIVE[2] PLANTS.


Most[3] of the fruits which grow on trees, _such_ as our apples and
pears, have[4] been greatly[5] improved and raised[6] above their natural
state by grafting and other artificial means.

Of[7] cultivated native plants, the chief are celery[8], parsley, the
cabbage, turnip, carrot, parsnips, and the hop. The onion is[9] a
native of South France, the lettuce of Greece, the radish of China, and
the rhubarb, now[10] so largely used in pies and puddings, of Russia.
Cress comes from[11] Persia, spinach from some[12] part of Asia, and
the Jerusalem artichoke[13] from Brazil.—HEWITT, PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY OF
ENGLAND AND WALES.

[1] +veredelt.+

[2] +einheimisch.+

[3] The clause ‘Most — trees’ may be briefly rendered by ‘+Die meisten
Baumfrüchte+’.

[4] Here follows the adverbial clause ‘by grafting — means’.

[5] +bedeutend.+

[6] ‘raised — state’ may be elegantly rendered by the p. p. ‘cultivated’
(+veredelt+).

[7] Say ‘The principal cultivated native plants are’, etc.

[8] See S. 3, N. 2. I should recommend to repeat the art. before each of
the following six nouns.

[9] is a native _of_, +stammt ~aus~+.

[10] ‘Now — puddings’. This elliptic clause must be completed in German.
Say ‘which is now so largely (much) used in pies (+Pasteten+) and

THE BEQUEST[1].

I.


An old avaricious English gentleman[2] had three sons, of whom one[3]
was a good-natured but light-minded fellow. Whenever (S. 18, N. 6) he
fell[4] into any trouble, he excused himself on[5] the ground that[6]
he was seeing life. His prodigality, however, annoyed[7] his father so
much[8], that he resolved to disinherit (S. 1, N. 2) him. His friends
interceded[9] in his favour, but their efforts were in vain.

When the old gentleman[10] felt his end approaching, he called his sons
together[11], and said to them: “I leave[12] to my son John my whole
estate[13], and desire him[14] to be frugal.” John[15], in a sorrowful
tone, as is usual on such occasions, prayed heaven to prolong his
father’s life, and give him health to enjoy the gift[16] himself.

[1] +Das Vermächtnis.+

[2] +Engländer.+

[3] Say ‘the one’.

[4] to fall into trouble, +in Verlegenheit geraten+.

[5] on the ground, +damit+.

[6] +daß er das Leben kennen lerne.+ Comp. App. §§ 28 and 30.

[7] +verdrießen+. See S. 5, N. 2.

[8] +sehr.+

[9] to intercede in a person’s favour, +zu gunsten einer Person
sprechen+. He interceded in my favour, +er sprach zu meinen gunsten+.
Supply the adverb +zwar+ (it is true) after the verb.

[10] +Herr+; to feel one’s end approaching, +sein Ende heran´nahen
fühlen+.

[11] together, +zu sich+.

[12] ‘to leave’, here = to bequeath.

[13] +Besitzung+, f.

[14] The construction of =the Infinitive with an Accusative=, so
frequently employed in English as an imitation of the Latin and Greek,
=is unknown in German=. Such constructions must be rendered by a
subordinate clause introduced by the conjunction ~+daß+~; as—

    I know _him to be_ an industrious man.

    +Ich weiß, daß er ein fleißiger Mann ist+.

See also App. § 34, and say ‘and wish that he may be frugal (+sparsam+)’.

[15] This passage requires the following construction: ‘As (+wie+) it is
usual (+üblich+) on (+bei+) such occasions, John (App. § 15) implored
heaven in (+mit+) a sorrowful tone to prolong’, etc. The noun +Himmel+ is
always used with the article.

The father continued: “I leave to my son James my money[1], amounting[2]
to four thousand pounds[3].” “Ah, father,” said[4] James, of course
in[4] great affliction, “may (App. § 34) heaven give you life and
health to enjoy the gift yourself.” The[5] father, then addressing the
spendthrift, said: “As[6] for you, Dick, you[7] will never come to good;
you will never be rich. I leave you a shilling to (S. 19, N. 7) buy[8] a
halter.” “Ah, father,” said Dick in _a_ most[9] melancholy voice, “may
heaven give you life and health to enjoy the gift yourself!”—ANONYMOUS.

[1] ‘money’, here = ready money, +bares Geld+.

[2] to amount to something, +sich ~auf~ etwas belaufen+. See S. 16, N. 4.

[3] +=Das Pfund=+, one pound English money, never takes the sign of the
Plural in German, and the same refers to ‘+=die Mark=+’, a German coin
corresponding to one shilling English.

[4] said = exclaimed; in = with.

[5] Say ‘Upon this the father addressed himself (+sich wenden+) to (+an+)
the spendthrift and said’.

[6] As — Dick, +Was dich betrifft, Richard.+

[7] Introduce this clause by the adverbial conjunction +so+, and see App.
§ 15; to come to good, +zu etwas Rechtem kommen+.

[8] =The German language, as a rule, requires that the person for whose
benefit an action is performed, is clearly indicated. When this is not
done by a noun in the dative case, it is generally done by means of the
dative of a personal pronoun=; as—

    I will buy a hat.

    +Ich will ~mir~ einen Hut kaufen.+

    We have built a house.

    +Wir haben ~uns~ ein Haus gebaut.+

Supply, therefore, the necessary pronoun after the conjunction +um+; a
halter = a rope, +Strick+, m.

[9] Render ‘most’ here by ‘+höchst+’.




_Section 59._

WHEAT.


Wheat is the most valuable[1] of all grains, because[2] from it, chiefly,
we obtain the flour of which bread is made. In order to make[3] flour,
the grains of wheat[4] are crushed[5] between stones in a mill. The
crushed mass is then separated[6] into two parts,—bran[7] and flour.
Bran is the outer husk of the grain, which is used (S. 4, N. 4) for[8]
fattening cattle, etc.[9] It[10] does no harm, however, to mix the bran
with the flour; the mixture is more nourishing than the pure flour. The
bran makes the flour and the bread darker _in colour_; but this is no
disadvantage, for brown bread is both[11] cheaper and more nourishing
than white bread. Bread[12] is often artificially whitened by[13] the
addition of alum and other injurious substances. Wheat is[14] chiefly
grown in France, Germany, Austria, Southern Russia, (S. 46, N. 6) the
British Isles, Australia, the United States, Canada, Egypt, and Northern
Africa.—NELSON’S READERS.

[1] +wertvoll+; ‘grain’, here +Kornart+, f.

[2] Say ‘because it yields (+liefern+) us chiefly the flour for our
bread’.

[3] +bereiten.+

OCCUPATION OF THE ANGLO-SAXONS.


Fishing (S. 40, N. 9) was a principal occupation, owing[1] to the
frequent abstinences from flesh-meat, enjoined[2] by (S. 59, N. 13) a
superstitious ritual[3]. Eels were taken[4] in immense numbers in the
marsh lands of the Eastern counties; salmon in the river Dee; herrings
along the shores of Suffolk, Kent, and Sussex, in[5] their annual
migration; while larger species, as[6] the whale and grampus[7], were
captured in the open sea. Hunting and falconry were the field-sports[8]
of the great. The beasts of the forest or chase, which were protected
by fines, and reserved[9] for privileged persons, were the[10] stag,
roebuck, hare, and rabbit. The wolf, fox, and boar might[11] be killed
by[12] any one with impunity, if (S. 27, N. 7) found without[13] the
limits of the chase or forest. The wild duck and heron were the[14]
common quarry.—MILNER, HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

(Extract from a sermon preached to a congregation of children at Chicago.)


When[2] I was in the Sunday-school, and had just begun to read about[3]
David, I[4] did not feel sure he ever was a real baby, and had to be
fed with a teaspoon; or that he ever was a real little boy[5] that[6]
went to school as I did, and played marbles[7], and had a peg-top[8], a
jack-knife[9], some slate pencils, ever[10] so many buttons, and a piece
of string[11], all in one pocket; that[12] he ever had to try hard not
to cry when he went to school very cold[13] mornings; or[14] that the
teacher spoke sharp to him, when the little chap had tried[15] his best
to get[16] his lesson, and[17] did not get it very well.

[1] +Zartfühlend, zuverlässig und treu.+

[2] Say ‘when I went to the Sunday-school’, and supply the adverb noch
after the subject.

[3] +über.+

[4] Say ‘I could scarcely imagine, that he ever really had been a little
child and had to be fed with a teaspoon (+und mit einem Theelöffel habe
gefüttert werden müssen+)’. By carefully reading §§ 29 and 30 of the
Appendix, the student will see that the verbs depending on the governing
verb ‘_imagine_’ must stand in the Perfect of the Subjunctive Mood.
According to S. 52, N. 8, however, the auxiliary ‘_sei_’ may be omitted
in the clause ‘that he ever really had been a little child’.

[5] +Junge.+ The auxiliary ‘+sei+’ may again be omitted here.

[6] that = who; as I did = ‘like myself’, which place immediately after
the relat. pron.

[7] +Schusser+. Remember that both this and the next clause are depending
on the relative clause ‘that — did’; place, therefore, the verb ‘played’
after ‘marbles’, and the verb ‘had’ after ‘peg-top’.

But you[1] know, ministers[2] have to find out all about such men as
David; and I have found out enough to[3] make me feel sure he was once
a little boy, _just_ like _one of_ you; that he had[4] to learn verses,
like you; and didn’t like (S. 20, N. 2, _A_) it, like you; and that he
did not like to go to bed early, or to get up early, like you.

I rather[5] fear that, in the summer, he[6] ate green apples, unripe
melons, hard peaches, and sour plums, as[7] you _do_; and[8] got sick,
and was very sorry, and had to take[9] medicine, as you _do_; that he
said he would (App. § 28) never do it again, and that he[10] then never
did _do_ it again, as[11] I hope you will neither.

[4] The auxiliaries ‘=to have=’ and ‘=to be=’ followed by the infinitive
of another verb, must generally be rendered by the auxiliary verb of mood

Now[1], just here I was trying to see what[2] sort of boy David was when
he grew[3] bigger; and, when I shut my eyes, and _so_ tried[4] to see
_it_ all clearly, I heard a noise right[5] under my study window. This
was[6] about[7] four o’clock, Friday afternoon; the schools were out,
and the children running home[8]. I turned my head to see what was the
matter[9], and then (App. § 14) I saw what I want[10] to tell you. About
ten boys were standing together[11]. All at once a big boy knocked[12] a
little boy[13] down, and rolled him in the snow[14]. The little boy got
up[15], and said: “What[16] did you do that for?” Then[17] the big boy
again approached the little boy[13], and I believe[18] he would have
knocked him down again[19], had not the little boy[13] walked sobbing
away[20] towards home.

“There,” I said, when I had seen that, “I know what David never did _do_:
he (S. 5, N. 2) never struck a boy that[1] was no match for him; he never
was a coward like that big boy; for he[2] is a coward to[3] strike a
small boy so; and those[4] others are not the boys (S. 16, N. 10) they
ought[5] to be, to[6] stand by and see it done.” I saw such[7] a thing in
a picture once, which was called the Wolf and the Lamb. A great, cruel
boy[8] meets a small, delicate lad[9] who has lost his father, and stands
over him with[10] his fist doubled, just as I saw that boy _stand_ under
my study window. I think[11] if[12] any[13] boy in this church were[14]

Once I read in the Life[1] of Dr. Channing, who was one of the best men
that ever (+je+) lived[2] (a[3] great deal better than David, because
he lived[4] in a better time), what he once did, when he was a[5] boy
and saw a[6] thing like that. Little Channing was one of the kindest[7]
and most tender-hearted boys I[8] ever heard of. I will tell you a
story to show you how[9] kind he was, and tender, and true. One day he
found in a bush a nest full[10] of young birds just out of the shell.
Children, did[11] you ever see a[12] nest full of birds just out of the
shell?—little tiny[13], downy things[14], with[15] hardly more feathers
than an oyster? The birds which William Channing found, were just of that
kind; and when he touched them with his fingers, and felt how soft and
warm they were, they all began to gape[16], very[17] much as you do when
I preach[18] a very long sermon.

Well, little (S. 10, N. 2) Channing knew[1] the birds did not gape
because he preached a long sermon, but (S. 6, N. 10) because they were
hungry. So[2] what did he do? He ran straight[3] home (S. 63, N. 8),
got[4] some nice soft crumbs of bread, and fed the little birds with
them (S. 4, N. 5, _B_); and[5] after that he fed them regularly every
day after[6] having come home from school. But[7] one day (S. 19, N. 2),
when he went to[8] the nest, there it lay on the ground, torn and bloody,
and the little birds all dead; and the father-bird[9] was crying[10]
on a wall, and the mother-bird[11] was crying on a tree. Then little
Channing tried[12] to tell them that he did not kill[13] their poor young
brood; that[14] he never could do such a mean, cruel thing as that, and
that[15], on the contrary[16], he had tried to feed them. But it was no

Now[1] this was the sort of boy Channing was; and I was going[2] to tell
you that (S. 66, N. 15) one day he heard of a big boy beating (S. 16, N.

a little boy; he was a little man when he was full grown[5]; but _then_
he had a big soul. I was going[2] to say he had a soul as big as a
church; but indeed[6] his soul was bigger than all _the_ churches in[7]
the world;—and when he heard of that[8] cruel boy, who was ever[9] so
much larger than himself, he went right up to him, and said: “Did[10] you
strike that little boy?” “Yes, I did[11]; and what then?”—“Then,” said
Channing, “you are a coward, because he was no match for you; and now
I am going[2] to whip[12] you for _doing_ it.” Because he had a big
soul, and though he was a small boy, he[13] went in, and fought for the
right. That was the only time he[14] ever fought in his life. But[15] I,
standing in[16] this pulpit, honour him more for it than if he had (App.

The[2] exquisite pleasure we enjoy from the smell of sweet flowers
is[3] alone sufficient to account for the love of perfumery. Flowers
pass away[4] so quickly that we naturally desire to preserve their
sweetness[5] as[6] long as we can, and in this our perfumers succeed[7]
admirably. The perfume[8] of most flowers depends upon an oil, which[9]
is peculiar to the plant, almost every sweet-scented[10] plant having its
own peculiar oil; and, what is of[11] more importance: these oils belong
to a class called[12] essential or volatile, because they become[13]
volatile when[14] heated.

[1] +Ueber Parfümerien.+

[2] Say ‘the great enjoyment which the smell (+Duft+, m.) of sweet
(+wohlriechend+) flowers affords (+gewähren+) us’. Place the pron. ‘us’

The common or fixed[1] oils, on the contrary, _such_ as olive[2] or
linseed-oil, do not evaporate. This[3] may be easily illustrated, thus:
If a piece of writing-paper be touched[4] with a fixed oil or grease,
(S. 27, N. 8) it leaves[5] a stain, which[6], upon being held before the
fire, will not disappear.

Now[7], if any[8] plant has a peculiar smell or taste, it is[4]
generally found that its essential oil is the cause of this (S. 4, N.

essence.—PROF. ASCHER.

[1] +fest+; on the contrary, +hingegen+. See S. 15, N. 3.

[2] as olive or linseed-oil, +wie das Oliven- oder Leinsamenöl+. When
two =compound nouns= which have the last component in common follow each
other, the last component is generally omitted in the first noun, which
is connected with the next one by means of hyphens.—To evaporate, +sich
verflüchtigen+.

[3] +Dies läßt sich auf folgende Weise leicht beweisen.+

[4] Turn the Passive Voice here into the Active Voice by means of the
pron. +man+, as explained in S. 4, N. 4.

[5] ‘to leave’, here = to leave behind; it = this.

[6] The passage ‘which — disappear’ may be briefly rendered, thus: ‘which
does not disappear before the fire’. See S. 32, N. 11.

[7] Reverse the order of the first two words in this clause.

[8] any = a.

[9] Consequently = therefore, +also+, which place after the subject ‘we’.

_Section 72._

ON INSTINCT[1].


The[2] following most curious instance of a change of instinct is
mentioned by Darwin. The bees carried[3] over to[4] Barbadoes and the
Western Isles ceased[5] to lay up any honey after the first year, as[6]
they found it not useful _to them_. They found the weather so fine, and
the materials[7] for making honey so plentiful, that they quitted[8]
their grave, prudent[9], _and_ mercantile[10] character, became
exceedingly profligate and debauched[11], ate[12] up their capital,
resolved to work no more, and[13] amused themselves by flying about the
sugar-houses and stinging the blacks. The[14] fact is, that[15], by[16]
putting animals in different situations[17], you may[18] change, and
even reverse, _any of_ their original propensities. Spallanzani[19]
brought[20] up an eagle upon[21] bread and milk, and fed a dove on[22]
raw beef.—REV. S. SMITH.

[1] +Über den tierischen Instinkt.+

[2] This clause requires a different rendering; let us say ‘Darwin gives
the following most (+höchst+) curious example of a change of the animal
instinct’. The last noun requires the def. art., as explained in S. 3, N.
2.

[3] to carry over, +hinü´berbringen+. The Perfect Participle qualifies
the noun ‘bees’. According to S. 7, N. 3, the words ‘carried — Isles’
may be rendered either by the attributive construction or by forming of
them a relative clause. I venture to propose the use of the attributive
construction as the more elegant of the two modes of rendering, and more
especially in order to avoid a repetition of subordinate clauses.

[4] When the preposition ‘=to=’, in connection with a verb denoting
motion, stands before the names of countries, towns, islands, etc., it
must be rendered by ‘+=nach=+’.

[5] Here follow the words ‘after — year’, to lay up honey, +einen Vorrat
von Honig an´sammeln+.

[6] See S. 41, N. 6; it = this; not useful, +nicht mehr von Nutzen+.

[7] materials — plentiful, +Materialien zur Honigbereitung in solchem
Überflusse vorhanden+.

[8] +auf´geben.+

[9] prudent = cautious.

[10] +merkantilisch.+

[11] +unmäßig.+

[12] to eat up, +auf´zehren+.

[13] +und sich daran ergötzten.+ For rendering the passage ‘by — blacks’
see S. 1, N. 3. To fly about, +umschwär´men+, v. tr.

[14] The — is, +Es ist eine ausgemachte Thatsache.+

[15] Here follows the subject ‘you’ (comp. S. 66, N. 15), which translate
by the impers. pron. +man+.

[16] by — animals, +durch Versetzung der Tiere+, i.e. by _a_ removal of
the animals. In = into; different = other.

[17] Here follows the object and its attributes, ‘their original
(+angeboren+) propensities (+Trieb+, m.)’.

[18] may = can; reverse, +in entgegengesetzte Richtungen leiten+.

PETER THE GREAT AND THE MONK.


Peter the Great ordered[1] many foreign books to be translated into the
Russian language, and among others[2] “Puffendorf’s[3] Introduction to
the Knowledge of the States of Europe.” A monk, to whom the translation
of this book was committed[4], presented[5] it some time after[6] to
the Emperor. The monarch examined[7] the translation; at[8] a certain
chapter, however, he suddenly changed[9] countenance, turned indignantly
to the monk, and said: “Fool, what did I order[10] thee to do? Is this a
translation?” He[11] then referred to the original and showed the poor
monk a paragraph in which the author had spoken with great asperity[12]
of the Russians, but which had not been translated. “Go,” resumed the
monarch, “and instantly carry out[13] what I have bidden thee _to do_.
_It is_ not to (S. 19, N. 7) flatter my subjects _that_ I[14] have
ordered this book to be translated, but (S. 6, N. 10) to instruct[15] and
reform[16] them!”—ANONYMOUS.

[1] Use the auxiliary verb of mood ‘+=lassen=+’ as a translation of ‘=to
order=’, ‘=to command=’, and ‘=to cause=’, when these verbs are connected
with the auxiliary ‘=to be=’ and the Past Participle of another verb; as—

    The emperor _ordered_ the ringleaders _to be shot_.

    +Der Kaiser ~ließ~ die Anführer ~erschießen~.+

    The admiral _commanded_ the ships _to be drawn up_ in order
    of battle.

    +Der Admiral ~ließ~ die Schiffe in Schlachtordnung
    ~aufstellen~.+

    He _caused_ the money _to be paid_ to me.

    +Er ~ließ~ mir das Geld ~auszahlen~.+

[2] Supply here the adverb +auch+.

[3] +Puffendorfs Beiträge zur europäischen Staatenkunde.+

[4] +an´vertrauen.+

[5] +überrei´chen+; it = the same, which must agree with its antecedent
‘translation’.

[7] +prüfen.+

[8] +bei.+

[9] to change countenance, +die Farbe wechseln+.

[10] ‘to order’, here +befehlen+. See S. 48, N. 2.

[11] Say ‘Hereupon he opened (+auf´schlagen+) the original’.

[12] +Schärfe+, f.; had spoken ... of = had expressed himself (+sich

[13] +verrichten.+

[14] Inverted construction.

THE BEAUTY OF THE EYE.

I.


Look[1] how beautiful the human eye is, excelling[2] in beauty the eye
of every creature! The eyes of many _of the_ lower animals are doubtless
very beautiful. All[3] of us must have admired the bold, fierce, bright
eye of the eagle; the large, gentle, brown eye of the ox; the treacherous
green eye of the cat, waxing[4] and waning[5] like the moon, as[6] the
sun shines upon it (S. 4, N. 5) or[7] deserts it; the pert eye of the
sparrow; the sly eye of the fox; the peering[8] little bead[9] of black
enamel in[10] the mouse’s head; the[11] gem-like eye which[12] redeems
the toad from ugliness; and the intelligent, affectionate expression,
which[13] looks out from the human-like eye of the horse and dog.
There[14] are these and the eyes of many other animals full of beauty;
but[15] there is a glory which excelleth in the eye of man.

[1] Use the 2nd pers. sing.

[2] Say ‘and how it excelleth in (+an+) beauty the eye of every other
creature!’ The words ‘in beauty’ should be placed before the verb.

[3] All of us, +wir alle+; all of them, +sie alle;+ all of you, +ihr+ (or
+Sie+) +alle+. Render the words ‘must have’ by ‘have certainly’. The p.
p. should be placed after ‘eagle’.

[4] +sich vergrößern.+

[5] +sich verkleinern.+

[6] as = according as, +je nachdem+.

[7] or deserts it = or not.

[8] +forschend.+

[9] +Perlenauge.+

[11] +das einem Edelsteine gleichende Auge.+

[12] Say ‘which lets us forget the ugliness of the toad’.

[13] which — the = in the.

[14] There are these ... full = These ... are full. Full of, +voller+.

[15] +im Auge des Menschen jedoch liegt eine alles übertreffende Pracht.+




_Section 75._

THE BEAUTY OF THE EYE.

II.


We realise[1] this fully only when[2] we gaze into the faces of those
we love. It[3] is their eyes (S. 16, N. 10) we look at[4] when we are
near them, and[5] recall when we are[6] far away. The face is a[7] blank
without the eye, and the eye seems to concentrate every[8] feature in
itself. _It is_ the eye _that_ smiles, not the lips; _it is_ the eye
_that_ listens[9], not the ear; it[10] that frowns, not the brow; it[11]
that mourns, not the voice. Every sense and every faculty[12] seems
to[13] flow toward it, and find expression through it[14], nay[15], to be
lost in it; for all must have felt at times as[16] if a man’s eye was not
a part of him, but (S. 6, N. 10) the man himself; as[17] if it had not
merely life, but also a[18] personality of its own;—as[19] if it was not
only a living, but also a thinking being.—PROF. G. WILSON.

[1] ‘to realise’, here = to comprehend, +begreifen+. The object ‘this’
may be emphasized by being placed at the head of the clause. Fully only,
+erst ganz+.

[2] Say ‘when we look upon (+betrachten+) the face (+Antlitz+, n.) of our
loved ones (+unserer Lieben+)’.

[3] +Es sind.+

[4] +anblicken.+

[5] and which we recall (+sich zurückrufen+).

[6] are far away, +fern von ihnen weilen+.

[7] a blank = expressionless.

[8] Supply here the adj. ‘individual’ (+einzeln+).

[9] +lauschen.+

[10] Say ‘the eye frowns (+zürnen+, i.e. to look angry)’.

[11] Say ‘the eye is sad’.

[12] +Gemütsstimmung+, f.

[13] to — it, +dahin zu strömen+.

[14] ‘it’, here = the same.

[15] +ja, darin aufzugehen.+

[16] as if ... was, +als wäre+; a man’s eye = the eye of a man.

[17] as if it had, +als hätte es+.

[18] a personality of its own = a self-dependent personality.

[19] as if it was, +als wäre es+.




_Section 76._

A FUNERAL DANCE[1].


Drums were beating[2], horns blowing[3], and[4] people were seen all
running in one direction. The cause was a funeral dance. I joined[5] the
crowd, and soon found myself in[6] the midst of the entertainment[7].
The dancers were most (+höchst+) grotesquely[8] got up[9]. About a dozen
huge ostrich feathers adorned their helmets. Leopard or black and white
monkey-skins[10] were suspended[11] from their shoulders, and a leather,
tied (S. 7, N. 3, _A_) round the waist, covered a large iron bell which
was strapped[12] upon the loins of each dancer; this they rang[13] to the
time of the dance. A large crowd got up in[14] this style[15] created[16]
an indescribable hubbub, heightened[17] by the blowing of[18] horns and
the beating of seven nogaras[19] of various notes[20]. Every dancer
wore[21] an antelope’s horn[22] suspended round the neck, which he blew
occasionally in[23] the height of his excitement.—SIR S. BAKER, THE
ALBERT N’YANZA.

[1] +Ein Tanz zur Leichenfeier.+

[2] were beating = were being beaten. See S. 2, N. 1. To beat a drum,
+eine Trommel rühren+.

[3] horns (were) blowing = horns resounded (+ertönen+).

[4] Say ‘and one saw all (+alles+) people run in (+nach+) one direction.

[5] +sich an´schließen+, which requires the dat.

[6] in the midst, +inmitten+, which requires the gen.

[7] entertainment = festivity.

[8] +grotesk.+

[9] ‘to get up’, here +aus´staffieren+.

[10] ‘skin’, here +Fell+, n., of which form a compound expression with
the pl. of the nouns ‘leopard’ and ‘monkey’, as explained in S. 71, N. 2.

[11] were suspended = hung; from = +von ... herab+.

[12] to be strapped, +mit einem Riemen befestigt sein+; ‘upon’ here +an+.

[13] +schellen+; to — dance, +während des Tanzens zum Takte+.

[14] +auf+.

[15] style = manner.

[16] created = made.

[17] Say ‘which was (Passive) still heightened’, according to S. 7, N. 3,
_B_.

[18] Use the gen. of the def. art.

[19] ‘nogaras’—which use in its unaltered form in German—are a kind of
drum.

[20] notes = sounds.

[21] wore ... suspended = had ... hanging; ‘round’, here +an+.

[22] To render ‘antelope’s horn’ form a compound noun of the pl. of the
noun ‘antelope’ and the singl. of the noun ‘horn’. Comp. S. 36, N. 7,
_A_, _B_, and _C_, and mark further:

_A._ Although the first component of =Compound Nouns= is generally in
the singular, =some require the plural=; as—+Kinderstube+, f., nursery;
+Bildergallerie+, f., picture-gallery.

_B_, 1. The first component takes sometimes one of =the genitive
inflections +s+, +es+, +n+, +en+, or +ens+=, according to the declension
it belongs to; as—+Königsmantel+, m., royal mantel; +Tageslicht+, n.,
day-light; +Heldenmut+, m., heroism; +Friedensliebe+, f., love of peace.

2. We find, however, =the terminations +s+ or +es+ used as a connecting
link= between the two components =for the mere sake of euphony=, even
in cases where the first component is a feminine noun; this is more
especially the case when the first component is in itself a compound
expression, when it has one of the derivative suffixes +heit+, +ing+,
+ling+, +keit+, +schaft+, +tum+, +ung+, or when it is a noun of foreign
origin terminating in +ion+, +at+, and +ät+; as—+Geburtstag+, m.,
birthday; +Hochzeitsgeschenk+, n., wedding present; +Weisheitslehre+, f.,
philosophy; +Religionsduldung+, f., toleration; +Universitätsgericht+,
n., university court.

_C._ In a few compound nouns we find one of the euphonic terminations
=+e+, +er+, and +l+ used as a connecting link= between the two
components; as—+Tagewerk+, n., day’s work; +Aschermittwoch+, m.,
Ash-Wednesday; +Heidelbeere+, bilberry.

_D_, 1. When =the first component= consists of =the stem of a verb=,
it is often joined to the second component without a connecting link;
as—+Schreibbuch+, n., copy-book.

2. Sometimes =a euphonic +e+ is used as a connection link=;
as—+Zeigefinger+, m., forefinger; +Haltepunkt+, m., place of stopping.

[23] in — excitement = in the highest excitement.




_Section 77._

ABSOLUTION BEFOREHAND[1].


When Tezel[2] was at Leipzig, in the sixteenth century (App. § 9), and
had collected[3] a great deal of money from all ranks[4] of people, a
nobleman, who suspected imposition, put[5] the question to him: “Can
you[6] grant absolution for a sin which a man[7] shall intend to commit
in future?” “Yes,” replied the frontless commissioner, “but on[8]
condition that a proper[9] sum of money be actually[10] paid down.” The
noble (S. 5, N. 2) instantly produced the sum demanded, and in return[11]
received a diploma[12], sealed and signed by Tezel, absolving[13] him
from the unexplained crime which he intended to commit. Not[14] long
after, when Tezel was about (S. 6, N. 4) to leave Leipzig, the nobleman
made[15] inquiry respecting the road he would probably travel[16],
waited[17] for him in ambush at a convenient place, attacked and robbed
him, then[18] beat him soundly with a stick, sent him back to Leipzig
with[19] his chest empty, and[20] at parting said: “This is the fault[21]
I intended to commit, and for which I have your absolution[22].”—REV. R.
K. ARVINE.

[1] +Der im voraus erteilte Ablaß.+

[2] +~Johann Tezel~ (eigentlich Diezel) wurde um 1460 zu Leipzig geboren,
trat 1489 in den Dominikanerorden, ward 1502 vom Papst zum Ablaßprediger

Ablaßhandel in Sachsen betraut, zog sich jedoch, von Luther seit dem
31ˢᵗᵉⁿ Oktober 1517 wegen seiner unverschämten Anmaßungen bekämpft, in
das Paulinerkloster zu Leipzig zurück, wo er im Jahre 1519 verstarb.+

[3] +ein´nehmen+; a great deal of, +eine Masse+. Construe accord. to App.
§ 5.

[4] ranks = classes; people, +Bevölkerung+, f., see S. 3, N. 2.

[5] ‘to put a question to somebody’ here = to ask somebody.

[6] I propose to use the 2nd pers. pl. in this case, and to supply the
adverb +auch+ after the pron.

[7] a — future = which one only (+erst+) intends to commit. See App. § 19.

[8] +unter+, followed by the def. art.

[9] +angemessen+; to render ‘sum of money’ form a comp. n. of which the
noun ‘money’ forms the first component and the noun ‘sum’ the last.

[11] in return, +dafür+, which place after the verb.

[12] ‘diploma’, here +Ablaßbrief+, m.

[13] +absolvieren+. See S. 16, N. 4; unexplained, +ungenannt+.

[15] to make inquiry respecting something, +sich nach etwas erkundigen+.

[16] ‘to travel’, here +ein´schlagen+.

[17] to wait in ambush for somebody, +einen in einem Hinterhalte
auf´lauern+.

[18] the adverb +dann+ must be placed after the object. To beat a person
soundly with a stick, +einen tüchtig durch´prügeln+.

[19] Say ‘with empty chest (+Kasten+, m.)’, which place immediately after
the object.

[20] +und rief ihm beim Abschied noch zu.+

[21] ‘fault’, here = sin.

[22] Supply here the adverb +schon+.

STAND UP[1] FOR WHATEVER IS TRUE, MANLY, AND LOVELY[2].

I.


In[3] no place in the world has individual character more[4] weight
than at a public school. Remember[5] this, I beseech[6] you, _all_ you
boys who[7] are getting into the upper forms. Now[8] is the time when
you may[9] have more[10] influence for good or evil in the society you
live in than you ever can have[11] again. Quit[12] yourselves like men,
then; speak out[13] and stand up for whatever is true, manly, and lovely.
Never (S. 68, N. 2) try to be popular[13], but _only_ do your duty, and
help[14] others to do theirs; and when you leave the school (S. 27, N.
8), the[15] tone of feeling in it will be higher than you found it, and
so you[16] will do good to[17] generations of your countrymen yet unborn.
For boys follow one another in herds like sheep, for[18] good or evil;
they[19] hate thinking, and[20] have rarely _any_ settled[21] principles.

[1] Use the 2nd pers. pl.; whatever = all that; see S. 3, N. 7.

[2] +schön.+

[3] In no place = Nowhere.

[4] more weight = greater influence.

[5] Remember this = Think (2nd pers. pl.) of it; see S. 4, N. 5, _B_.

[6] +bitten.+

[7] +=Der=+ (m. sing.), +=die=+ (f. sing.), and +=die=+ (pl.) must be
used =as relative pronouns= in reference to a personal pronoun of the
first or second person of either number, and also in reference to the
personal pronoun of the third person plural (+Sie+) used instead of the
second person plural. For the sake of emphasis the personal pronoun is
frequently repeated after the relative pronoun, and the verb must then
agree with the personal pronoun, as the following examples will show.

    +Verschmähst du ~mich~, ~die ich~ deine Freundin bin?+

    Dost thou disdain _me_, _who_ am your friend?

    +~Ich~, ~der ich~ dich von deinen Feinden befreite.+

    _I_, _who_ delivered thee from thy enemies.

Construe the clauses ‘who — forms’ accordingly; to get into the upper
forms, +in die obern Klassen versetzt werden+.

[8] Say ‘The time has [is] come’; when, +wo+.

[9] may have = exercise (+aus´üben+) likely.

[10] Say ‘more good or evil influence upon (+auf+) the company
surrounding you (+Eure Umgebung+)’.

[11] have = exercise.

[12] Say ‘Be therefore manly’.

[13] ‘to speak out’, here +gerade und frei heraus´sprechen+; ‘to be
popular’, here +sich beliebt machen+.

[14] When the following verbs are used in connection with another verb
governed by them, that verb stands in =the Infinitive without the
preposition +zu+= (Comp. S. 34, N. 10):

_A._ The auxiliary verbs of mood: +dürfen+, +können+, +mögen+, +müssen+,
+sollen+, +wollen+, and +lassen+. (see Expl. 1.)

_B._ The verbs: +bleiben+, +fahren+, +gehen+, +finden+, +fühlen+,
+heißen+ (to bid, to command), +helfen+, +hören+, +lehren+ (also with
+zu+, Comp. S. 43, N. 10), +lernen+, +machen+, +sehen+, and +reiten+.
(See Expl. 2.)

_C._ The verb +haben+ in phrases like Expl. 3.

_D._ The verb +thun+ followed by +nichts+. (See Expl. 4.)

EXAMPLES.

    1. +Ich ~mag~ gern ~schreiben~.+

    I am very fond of writing; I like to write.

    2. +Der Diener ~fand~ seinen Herrn tot am Boden ~liegen~.+

    The servant found his master lying dead on the floor.

    3. +Er ~hat~ gut ~reden~.+

    It is all very well for him to talk.

    4. +Er ~thut nichts~ als ~essen~ und ~trinken~.+

    He does nothing but eat and drink.

[15] the — higher = the moral tone of the same (gen.) will be a higher
_one_ (S. 67, N. 3).

[16] Supply here the adverb +noch+.

[17] +an+; remember that the p. p. ‘unborn’ is used as an adj. and
qualifies the noun ‘generations’.

Every school (S. 5, N. 2), indeed, has its own traditionary standard[1]
of right and wrong, which cannot be transgressed with impunity,

lawful and right. This standard is ever[4] varying, though _it changes_
only slowly and little by little. It[5] is the leading[6] boys only, who

WORK[1] IS A GREAT COMFORTER.


Two neighbouring gardeners had the misfortune of[2] having their crop
of early peas killed by frost. The one called[3] upon the other to
condole[4] with him. “Ah,” cried he, “how unfortunate[5] we have been,
neighbour! Do you[6] know? I have done nothing but fret ever since[7].
But it seems you have there a fine healthy[8] crop[9] coming[10] up
already; what[11] is it?” “This?” cried the other gardener, “why[12], it
is a crop of peas (S. 16, N. 10) I sowed (S. 48, N. 2) immediately after
my loss.” “What[13], coming up already?” replied the fretter[14]. “Yes,
while you were fretting[15], I[16] was working.” “What! don’t you fret
when you have a loss?” “Yes, but I always put it off[17] until _after_
I have repaired[18] the mischief[19].” “Why, then you have no need to
fret at all.” “True[20],” replied the industrious gardener, “I[21] find

Robert Bruce, restorer[1] of the Scottish monarchy, being[2] pursued
one day by the enemy, was[3] obliged[4] to seek refuge in a barn and to
spend[5] the night there. In[6] the morning, when he awoke, he saw a
spider climbing up[7] the[8] beam of the roof. The spider fell[9] _down_
to the ground, but immediately tried to climb up again, when it a[10]
second time fell to the ground[11]. It made a third attempt, which also
failed. Twelve times did (S. 32, N. 11) the little spider try to climb up
the beam, and twelve times it fell down again, but the[10] thirteenth
time it succeeded[12] and[13] gained the top[14] of the beam. The king
(S. 5, N. 2) immediately got up[15] from his lowly[16] couch, and said:
“This little spider has taught (S. 42, N. 4) me perseverance; I will
follow its example. Twelve times have[17] I been beaten by the enemy. I
will try my fortune once more!” He did so[18], and won the next battle.
The king became the spider’s scholar.—N. GOODRICH.

THE NECESSITY OF[1] VOLCANOES.


The[2] remarkable proofs which modern geology has presented of vast
accumulations of heated[3] and melted matter[4] beneath the earth’s
crust[5], make it evident that (S. 3, N. 2) volcanoes are essential[6]
to the preservation of the globe. If (App. § 36) there[7] were no
safety-valves through[8] the crust, such vast accumulations of heat would
rend asunder[9] even[10] a whole continent. Volcanoes are[11] those
safety-valves[12], more than two hundred of which are scattered[13] over
the earth’s surface. But if no such passages[14] existed (see S. 27,
N. 8), nothing could prevent the[15] pent-up gases from accumulating
till they had (Impf. Subj.) gained strength[16] enough to rend a whole
continent, and[17] perhaps the whole globe, into fragments.—REV. PROF.
HITCHCOCK.

[1] Use the gen. of the def. art.

THE POWER OF BEAUTY.


In one of the worst parts of London there is[1] an institution[2] which I
visited. In one room I found about[3] thirty-five men listening (S. 16,
N. 4) to the teaching[4] of the daughter of a small shopkeeper[5] in[6]
the neighbourhood. She was one of the prettiest women (S. 16, N. 10) I
ever saw[7] in my life. I noticed that the young girl was quite alone
with those rough[8] men, and said to the superintendent[9]: “Are[10] you
not afraid to leave the pretty young girl alone with all those men?” He
replied: “I[11] am.” “Then, why don’t you go to her?” “You mistake[12] my
fear. I[13] am not afraid of their doing her any harm. They love her so
much that they would lick[14] the ground on which[15] she walks, but I
am afraid[16] that some[17] person may step in, who, not[18] knowing the

THE ENGLISH CLIMATE.


The air is generally very moist, most[1] so near the western coast, and
less so[2] as[3] we go eastward.

It[4] is to the abundant moisture of the air that the beautiful foliage
of our trees and the rich verdure of our fields and gardens, so much
praised by foreigners who visit England, are chiefly owing. Moisture is
one of the two things[5] most necessary to[6] vegetation, and hence[7]
our fields, trees, and woods possess during the greater part of the year
a continuous richness of[8] verdure, which[9] cannot be found under[10]
the sunny skies of the shores of the Mediterranean.

The weather is at[11] times liable to very sudden changes, depending
(S. 16, N. 4) mainly on the changes of the wind[12].—HEWITT, PHYSICAL

Seemingly[1] boundless is the region of the docks, and the visitor who

pursue, will constantly find himself allured from the path. He passes[2]
a door from[3] which issues a delicious fragrance of spice, and he turns
in[4] to (S. 19, N. 7) explore[5] it. At[6] the top of a stone staircase

DR. JOHNSON ON[1] DEBT.


Dr. Johnson held[2] that[3] debt is ruin. His[4] words on the subject
are weighty, and worthy of being held in remembrance. “Do not,” said[5]
he, “accustom[6] yourself to consider debt only as[7] an inconvenience.
You[8] will find it a calamity. Poverty takes[9] away so many means of
doing good, and[10] produces so much inability to resist evil, that
it[11] is by[12] all virtuous means to be avoided. Let[13] it be your
first care, then, not to be in any man’s debt. Resolve[14] not[15] to be
poor. Whatever[16] you have, spend less. Poverty[17] is a great enemy
to _human_ happiness. It destroys liberty. It makes some[18] virtues
impracticable[19] and others[20] extremely difficult. Frugality[21] is
not only the basis of[22] quiet, but[23] of beneficence[24]. No[25] man
can help others that wants himself. We must have[26] enough, before[27]
we have to spare.”—S. SMILES, SELF-HELP.

A gentleman[2], just returned[3] from a journey to (S. 72, N. 4) London,
was surrounded by[4] his children, eager[5], after the first salutation
was over, to hear the news, and still more eager to see the contents[6]
of a small portmanteau, which[7] were, one by one, carefully unfolded and
displayed to view. After[8] having distributed amongst the children a few
small presents, the[9] father took his seat again, saying, that[10] he
must confess he[11] had brought from town[12], for his own use, something
far more curious and valuable than any[13] of the little gifts (S. 16, N.
10) they had received. It was, he said[14], too good to[15] present to
any of them; but he would, if[16] they pleased, first give them a brief
description of it (S. 4, N. 5, _B_), and[17] then perhaps they might be

curtain, adorned[13] with a beautiful fringe, and[14] so placed as
to fall in a moment on the approach of the slightest danger. The[15]
external appearance of the instrument is always more or less beautiful,

matters[10] of mere conjecture. It[11] must be confessed, however, that
very much depends on a[12] proper application of it, being (S. 30, N.
4) possessed by many _persons_ who appear to have no[13] adequate sense
of its value, but[14] who employ it only for the most low and common
purposes, without _even_ thinking, apparently, of the noble uses[15] for
which it is designed, or of the exquisite[16] gratification[17] (S. 16,
N. 10) it is capable of affording. It[18] is indeed in order to excite in
your minds some higher sense of its value than you might otherwise have
entertained, that I am giving you this previous description.”

GEORGE. “Well _then_, tell us something more about it (S. 4, N. 5, _B_).”

FATHER. “It is also of[19] a very penetrating quality, and _it_ can often
discover secrets which can be detected by no other means. It[20] must be
owned, however, that[21] it is equally prone to reveal them[22].”

[1] Its — various = It serves for (+zu+) such (+so+) various purposes
(+Zweck+, m.).

A CURIOUS INSTRUMENT.

VII.


CHARLES. “What! can it speak then?”

FATHER. “It is sometimes said (S. 54, N. 13) to[1] do so, especially
when[2] it happens to meet with[3] one of its own species.”

GEORGE. “What colour are[4] these instruments?”

FATHER. “They vary[5] considerably in this respect.”

GEORGE. “Well, what colour is yours?”

FATHER. “I believe it is of _a_ darkish colour; but if I shall confess
the truth (S. 27, N. 8), I must say that I never saw (S. 48, N. 2) it[6]
in my life.”

BOTH. “Never[7] saw it in your life?”

FATHER. “No, nor[8] do I wish; but I have seen a representation of it,
which (S. 48, N. 6) is so exact that my curiosity is quite satisfied.”

GEORGE. “But why don’t you look[9] at the thing itself?”

FATHER. “I should be in great danger[10] of losing it, if I[11] did.”

CHARLES. “Then you could buy (S. 58, N. 8) another.”

FATHER. “Nay[12], I believe I could not prevail[13] upon any one to part
with such (S. 28, N. 9) a thing[14].”

GEORGE. “Then, how did you get yours?”

FATHER. “I am so fortunate as[15] to be possessed of more than one;
but[16] how I got them I really cannot recollect[17].”

CHARLES. “Not recollect! Why[18], you said you brought[19] them from
London to-night!”

FATHER. “So[20] I did; I should be sorry if I had left them behind me
(see App. § 36).”

CHARLES. “Now[21], father, _do_ tell us the name of this curious
instrument!”

FATHER. “It is—the Eye.”—JANE TAYLOR.

ANGLO[1]-SAXON DRESS.


The dress of civilians in general consisted[2] of a shirt and tunic
descending[3] to the knee, of linen or wool, according[4] to the season.
A belt was often worn round the waist[5], and a short cloak over the
whole. Drawers, leather shoes or short boots and hose, or sandals,
completed the ordinary costume. Labourers (S. 3, N. 2) are generally
represented with shoes, but without hose. Females[6] of all ranks[7]
wore long, loose garments reaching[3] to the ground, completely
hiding (S. 16, N. 4) all[8] symmetry of[9] shape. Long hair, parted[10]
on the forehead, and falling[11] naturally down the shoulders, with
_an_ ample[12] beard and moustache, distinguish the Anglo-Saxons from
the closely cropped[13] Normans. Planche remarks that[14] the character
of face, as delineated in illuminations, immediately designates[15]
the age[16] wherein[17] the early[18] portraits of our Lord[19], which
have[20] been reverently[21] copied to[22] the present day, were[23]
originally fabricated.—MILNER, HISTORY OF ENGLAND.

THE GLACIERS AT[1] SUNSET[2].

I.


At a distance these glaciers, as[3] I have said before, look[4] like
frozen rivers (S. 26, N. 3); when[5] one approaches nearer, or when they
press[6] downward[7] into the valley, they look[8] like immense crystals
and pillars[9] of ice piled[10] together in every conceivable form. The
effect[11] of this pile[12] of ice, lying (S. 48, N. 6) directly[13]
in the lap of[14] green grass and flowers, is quite singular. Before
we had entered[15] the valley, the sun had gone down; the sky behind
the mountains was clear, and it[16] seemed _for_ a few moments as if
darkness[17] was rapidly coming on. But[18] in a few moments commenced
a scene[19] of transfiguration, more[20] glorious than anything I had
witnessed yet. The cold, white, dismal fields[21] of ice gradually
changed[22] into hues[23] of the most beautiful rose colour[24]. A[25]
bank of white clouds, which rested[26] above the mountains, kindled[27]
and glared[28], as[29] if some spirit of light had entered into them.

[1] +bei+, contracted with the dat. of the def. art.

[2] Comp. S. 26.

[3] Place the words ‘as — before’ at the head of the whole passage; ‘at a
distance’, in +der Entfernung+. For the constr. see App. § 15.

[5] The clause ‘when — nearer’ may be briefly rendered by ‘+in der
Nähe+’, i.e. ‘close by’.

[6] +hinein´dringen.+

[7] +abwärts.+

[8] ‘to look’ may here be rendered by +aus´sehen+, to avoid repetition;
‘like’ must then be turned by ‘+wie+’.

[16] it seemed = it had the appearance. The adverbial circumstance of
time ‘_for_ a few moments’ may be emphasized by being placed immediately
after the conj. ‘and’.

[17] Darkness is coming on, +die Dunkelheit bricht herein+.

You[1] did not lose your idea of the dazzling, spiritual whiteness of
the snow; yet you seemed to see it through a rosy veil, the sharp edges
of the glaciers and the hollows between the peaks reflecting wavering
tints of lilac and purple. The effect[2] was solemn and spiritual above
everything I have ever seen. These[3] words, which[4] had often been
in my mind through the day, and[5] which occurred more often than any
others while I was travelling through the Alps, came into my mind with a
pomp and magnificence of meaning unknown before:—“For by (+durch+) Him
were all things created that are in[6] heaven and that are in earth,
visible and invisible, whether[7] they be thrones, or dominions, or
principalities, or powers[8]: all things were created by Him and for Him:
and He is before[9] all things, and by Him all things consist[10] (Col.
i. 16, 17).”—MRS. BEECHER STOWE.

[1] Say ‘The idea (+Bild+, n.) of the dazzling, spiritual (+geisterhaft+)
whiteness of the snow lost itself not; it seemed, however, as if one
saw it (+als sähe man es+) through a rosy veil, whilst the sharp edges
(+Zacke+, f.) of the glaciers and the hollows (+Vertiefung+, f.) between
the peaks were beaming (+erstrahlen+) in wavering (+unbestimmt+) colours

THE LOST CHILD FOUND[1].

I.


A few years since, in the United States of America, a child was lost[2]
in the woods. Darkness (S. 3, N. 2) was rapidly coming on[3], and the
alarmed father, accompanied by some of his neighbours, hastened away
in[4] search of the lost child. The[5] search continued in vain till
nine o’clock in the evening. Then the alarm bell was rung[6], and the
cry of fire[7] soon resounded through the streets. It[8] was, however,
ascertained that[9] it was not fire which caused the alarm, and that the
bell tolled[10] to spread the more[11] solemn tidings[12] of a child
lost[13].

Every heart sympathised[14] in the sorrows of the distracted[15] parents,
and multitudes[16] of the people[17] were seen (S. 4, N. 4) ascending the
hill upon the declivity of which the village was situated[18], to[19]
aid in the search. The night passed away, the morning dawned, and yet no
tidings came. The sun arose. The whole landscape glittered in the rays
of the morning sun. But the village was deserted and still; the shops
were closed, and business was hushed[20]. Mothers[21] were walking[22]
the streets with sympathising[23] countenances and anxious[15]
hearts. There[24] was but one thought there:—What has become of[25] the
lost[13] child?

[1] +Das wiedergefundene Kind.+

[2] to be lost, +sich verirren+.

[3] to come on, +heran´rücken+.

[4] in — child = to seek the missed child.

[5] The — evening = Till 9 o’clock in the evening (+abends+) their
endeavours had remained without success (+erfolglos+). =Remember that the
verbs +sein+, +werden+, and +bleiben+ are conjugated with the auxiliary
+sein+.=

[6] +ziehen.+

[7] Form a compound noun by combining the corresponding German terms of
the nouns ‘fire’ and ‘cry’ (S. 36, N. 7, _A_).

[8] it — ascertained, +Es stellte sich jedoch heraus+.

[9] that — alarm = that the alarm was not caused through fire.

[10] +ertönen.+

[11] more solemn = still more dreadful.

[12] tidings = message.

[13] Use the p. p. of the verb +vermissen+. See S. 7, N. 3, _A_.

[14] Say ‘shared the sorrow’ (+Kummer+, m., which is only used in the
Sing.).

[15] +angsterfüllt.+

[16] +Scharen.+

[17] of the people = of country-people.

[18] to be situated, +liegen+.

[19] to — search, +um mit suchen zu helfen+.

[20] ‘to be hushed’, here = to rest.

[21] Say ‘The women’.

[22] to walk the streets, +auf den Straßen umher´gehen+.

[23] +teilnehmend.+

[24] +Es war nur ein Gedanke, der alle erfüllte.+

[25] +aus.+




_Section 99._

THE LOST CHILD FOUND.

II.


About[1] nine in[2] the morning the signal gun was fired, which announced
that the child was found (S. 4, N. 4), and for[3] some time the suspense
was dreadful. Was the child found a[4] mangled corpse, or was it alive
and well? Soon (App. § 14) a joyful shout[5] proclaimed the safety of the
child. A procession was formed[6] by those engaged[7] in the search. The
child was placed upon a litter, hastily constructed[8] from the boughs of
trees (S. 36, N. 7, _A_), and borne[9] in triumph at[10] the head[11] of
the procession.

When they arrived at the brow[12] of the hill, they stopped _for_ a
moment, and proclaimed their success with three loud _and_ animated[13]
cheers[14]. The mother could no longer restrain her feelings. She rushed
into[15] the street, clasped her[16] child to her bosom, and wept aloud.
Every[17] eye was suffused with tears, and _for_ a moment all was silent.

But suddenly some one gave a[18] signal for[19] a shout. One long, loud,
_and_ happy note of joy[20] rose from[21] the assembled multitude[22],
who then dispersed to (S. 19, N. 7) return home and to resume[23] their
business.—JACOB ABBOTT.

[1] +gegen.+

[2] in the morning, +morgens+.

[3] for — time, +eine Zeit lang+.

[4] a = as a = +als+.

[5] joyful shout, +Freudengeschrei+ (S. 76, N. 22, _B_).

[6] Use the reflective form +sich bilden+; by, +von+.

[7] +welche sich bei der Auffindung des Kindes beteiligt hatten.+

[8] Use the attributive construction pointed out in S. 7, N. 3;
constructed, +zusam´mengefügt+; from, +aus+.

[9] +einher´tragen.+

[10] +an.+

[11] +Spitze+, f.

[12] brow = top.

[13] animated = fiery.

[14] +Hurras.+

[15] +auf.+

[16] her = the.

[17] Say ‘No eye was without tears (+thränenleer+)’.

[18] Use the def. art.

[19] +zu.+

[20] happy — joy, form a comp. noun of the corresponding German terms
‘joy’ and ‘cry’.

[21] +aus.+

[22] +Menge+, f.

[23] to resume business, +sich an sein Geschäft begeben+.




_Section 100._

PERSPIRATION.


Perspiration is the evacuation[1] of the juices of the body through
the pores of the skin. It has been calculated (S. 4, N. 4) that there
are[2] above three hundred millions _of_ pores in the glands of the
skin which covers the body of a middle-sized man. Through these pores
more than one half[3] of what we eat and drink passes off[4] by[5]
insensible[6] perspiration. If we consume eight pounds of food in[7] a
day (App. § 9; S. 27, N. 8), five pounds of it (S. 4, N. 5, _B_) are
insensibly discharged[8] by perspiration. During[9] a night of seven
hours’ sleep we perspire about two[10] pounds and a half. At an average
we may[11] estimate the discharge[1] by[12] sensible and insensible
perspiration at[13] _from_ half an ounce to[14] four ounces per hour.
This (+Dies+) is a most[15] wonderful part[16] of the animal economy,
and[17] is absolutely necessary to[18] our health, and even to our _very_
existence.—THE REV. DR. DICK.

[1] +Ausscheidung+, f.

[2] ‘(there) to be’, here +sich befinden+. Place the reflective pron.
after the conjunction +daß+. The words ‘above — pores’ come after the
relative clause ‘which — man’, after which place the verb +befinden+.

[3] +die Hälfte.+

[4] +entweichen.+

[5] +mittelst.+

[6] +unmerklich.+

[7] +an.+

[8] +aus´scheiden.+

[9] Say ‘During a seven hours’ (+siebenstündig+) sleep’.

[10] two pounds and a half, +drittehalb Pfund+.

[11] may = can.

[12] +durch.+

[13] +auf.+

[14] +bis.+

[15] Use the superlative of the adv. +hoch+.

[16] part — economy, +Einrichtung im tierischen Organismus+.

[17] Substitute a relative pronoun for the conjunction ‘and’, which will
improve the sentence very much.

[18] +für.+




_Section 101._

THE DRAMA OF THE FRENCH[1] REVOLUTION OF 1848.

I.


Our first scene is a palace; the period[2] winter; the time[3] morning,
and the weather cold and miserable[4]. It is ten o’clock, and the King
of France with his wife[5] and family are[6] discovered at the breakfast
table. A splendid beginning! Calmness[7] is the prevailing expression
of every countenance save one—the king’s daughter-in-law[8], who looks
anxious and disturbed. Light[9] domestic talk, _such_ as[10] becomes
princes and the gilded roof that[11] overhangs them, occupies[12] the
moments. Hush[13]! Whilst the lacqueys, dressed (S. 7, N. 3, _A_) in
gold and scarlet, move[14] noiselessly about the room, a noise is heard
without[15]. It[16] becomes more[17] audible by degrees. Suddenly the
door flies open, and two[18] men enter, pale as ghosts. They[19] are
Ministers of State (S. 76, N. 22, _A_). They have news to communicate.
Discontent prevails in the city; the[20] populace are out; the dragoons
have surrendered their sabres, the soldiers their arms, within[21] sight
of the apartment in which the king had just now enjoyed his meal, and his
daughter-in-law had looked[22] so sad.

[1] =National adjectives require a small initial in German.=

[2] period = season.

[3] time = day-time (S. 76, N. 22, _B_). Connect the two nouns by means
of the genitive inflection +es+.

[4] +rauh+.

[5] wife, consort, +=Gemahlin=+, which term generally applies to the
wife of a king, or to that of persons of the upper ranks of society.—The
possessive adj. pron. is best repeated before the next noun.

[6] Since the subject begins the sentence, the verb must be placed
immediately after it. Say ‘The king of France sits, etc.’, and transl.
the words ‘at — table’ briefly thus: +beim Frühstückstische+.

[7] Calmness — disturbed. This period is best construed thus: With _the_
exception of the king’s daughter-in-law (i.e. the daughter-in-law of the
king), who looks anxious and disturbed, bear (App. § 14) all _the_ faces
the expression of (S. 3, N. 2) calmness.—+Der König war ~Ludwig Philipp~,
geb. den 6. Oktob. 1773 zu Paris, ältester Sohn des Herzogs Ludwig
Philipp von Orléans. Nach der Julirevolution von 1830 bestieg er kraft
Kammerbeschlusses vom 7. Aug. als König der Franzosen den Thron. Durch
die Februarrevolution von 1848 gestürzt, floh er nach England, wo er
fortan in Claremont unter dem Titel eines Grafen von Neuilly lebte und im
Jahre 1850 starb. Seine Gemahlin war ~Maria Amalie von Sicilien~, welche
ebenfalls in England starb.+

[8] +Die Schwiegertochter des Königs war ~Helene, Herzogin von Orléans~,
verwitwete Gemahlin des im Jahre 1842 infolge eines Sprunges aus dem
Wagen beim Durchgehen der Pferde verunglückten Herzogs ~Ferdinand von
Orléans~, des ältesten Sohnes des Königs Ludwig Philipp, welcher acht
Kinder hatte.+

[9] Supply the indef. art. before the adj. ‘light’; ‘domestic’, here =
confidential; talk = conversation.

[10] such as, +wie+, after which supply the pron. +sie+ to agree with
‘conversation’. It becomes princes, +es paßt sich für Fürsten+.

[11] ‘_that — them_’, may be briefly turned by ‘over them’.

[12] occupies — moments, +läßt die Zeit schnell dahingehen+.

[13] +Horch!+

[14] to move, +sich bewegen+; about the room = in the room.

[15] without = outside.

[16] Use here a demonstrative pronoun to agree with ‘noise’.

[17] more — degrees = louder and louder.

[18] two men pale as ghosts, +zwei geisterbleiche Gestalten+.

[19] They are, +Es sind+.

[20] +Der Pöbel ist auf den Beinen.+

[21] within — meal = and this almost (+fast+) immediately in front
of (+vor+) the windows of the room in which the king had just now
breakfasted.—Use the verb in the Imperfect, and render _just now_ by
+soeben+.

[22] ‘to look sad’, here +trübe einher´blicken+, which use likewise in
the Imperfect.—=The German Imperfect is chiefly used as a historical
tense and to express a past action or occurrence with reference to
another.= It is, however, likewise used to denote the continuance of
an action, to describe a certain state, and to express customary and
habitual action. Comp. S. 48, N. 2, for the use of the Perfect.




_Section 102._

THE DRAMA OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1848.

II.


What is to be done? The king is thunderstruck[1], hesitates _for_ a
moment, and[2] then, urged[3] by the queen, instantly leaves the room.
The[4] queen follows[5] her husband with her (S. 43, N. 9, _A_) eyes
from the palace window. She sees[6] him on horseback[7] reviewing[8]
the National Guards[9]. She has no fear, neither[10] has he. What[11]
more? He returns, accompanied[3] by[12] the man whom[13], yesterday, to
satisfy public clamour, he created Prime Minister. Has the Minister power
to save his master? You (S. 92, N. 5) observe at[14] a glance that[15] he
is far more anxious to save himself. He craves[16] permission to resign.
Permission[17] is granted, when (S. 4, N. 2) a volley[18] is (S. 4, N.
4) heard close[19] to their ears. What does it mean? This[20] man will
tell you who now enters. The King has a pen in his hand, with which he
is about (S. 6, N. 4) to appoint his new Prime Minister. “Sign[21] not,”
shouts the[22] last comer, a[23] man of the press, with the face[24] of
a student, and the spirit[25] of a soldier. “Sign rather[26] your own
abdication.” The situation is fine[27]. The pen drops[28] from the King’s
fingers; the speaker[29] takes it up, and quietly[30] replaces[31] it in
the Monarch’s hand (see S. 43, N. 9).

[1] +wie vom Donner gerührt.+

[2] Here place the verb ‘leaves’.

[3] =The Past (Perfect) Participle is often used elliptically to denote
an existing state or condition=; as—

    Urged by his father, he instantly left the room.

    +Von seinem Vater gedrängt, verließ er eiligst das Zimmer.+

[4] Construe this period by beginning with the adverbial clause ‘from
the palace window’, +~von~ den Fenstern des Palastes ~aus~+. The verb
must then follow immediately. To denote a starting point with respect
to place, the English preposition ‘=from=’ is generally translated by
+=von=+ followed by the prepositional adverb +=aus=+, or by +aus ...
hinaus+ when the verb indicates a motion from one place to another. In
relation to time we use +=von ... an=+, which often corresponds to the

The audience[1] is already touched[2]. The poor king looks around him
for[3] advice; no[4] one offers it; even the Prime Minister of[5]
yesterday is dumb; and in[6] another instant the[7] deed is done. The
King has abdicated in[8] favour of his grandson[9]. Behind the scenes[10]
you (S. 92, N. 5) hear sounds[11] of tumult and disorder, and your[12]
heart is already beating for the issue. The King doffs[13] his robes[14],
places his sword upon the table, and[15], dressed (S. 102, N. 3) as _a_
private gentleman[16], is _evidently_ anxious[17] to depart. The Queen
would[18] fain meet the coming danger, but his[19] Majesty has already
ordered the carriages. The horses are put[20] to, but horses and groom
are shot[21] by the multitude[22]. A broad path leads from[23] the palace
garden[24], and at the end[25] of it a friendly hand[26] has brought two
hired coaches[27]. “Let[28] us go,” exclaims the Monarch, and, leaning
(S. 53, N. 12) heavily[29] upon the Queen, whose[30] head is high
and erect, he hurries on. The coaches are[31] reached; the fugitives
escape[32]. They arrive at St. Cloud[33], at Versailles, but not to (S.
19, N. 7. Supply the adv. dort) stay. On[34] they go, and at half-past
eleven o’clock at night they descend at Dreux[35].

THE DRAMA OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1848.

IV.


At one in the morning they are joined[1] by (+von+) one of the King’s
sons, who informs the unhappy pair that the claims[2] of the grandson
_had[3] been_ disregarded, and _that_ the republic had been declared by
the people of Paris. It is enough. The King shaves off his whiskers,
puts on green spectacles, buries[4] his face in a handkerchief, speaks
English, and calls himself Smith. The wind is[5] high, the coast[6]
dangerous, embarkation[7] is out of question at the moment, and before an
opportunity offers, the rank of the runaways[8] is discovered. Fortune
(S. 3, N. 2), however, is[9] with them: they escape[10] capture and put
to sea. Protected by Heaven, they reach in safety[11] the hospitable
shores of England.

Meanwhile[12], what has happened in Paris? The whole city has given
way[13] to a handful of rioters—men (S. 53, N. 9) who meditated
an “emeute[14]”, and effected, to their astonishment, an _actual_
revolution. But[15] two individuals upon the side of the King evinced
a[16] particle of courage, and these were women—his wife and his
daughter-in-law already[17] mentioned. The[18] rest of the city were[19]
faithless to themselves as well as to the King.

[1] ‘to be joined’, here +eingeholt werden+ (to be overtaken).

[2] Here +Thronansprüche+.

[3] According to the two rules in §§ 28 and 30 of the Appendix, the
Perfect of the Subjunctive Mood is to be used in this and the following
clause. The two clauses, however, can be joined by omitting the second
conjunction ‘that’ and the copula ‘had been’ of the first clause. Turn
‘to disregard’ by +nicht anerkennen+; the words ‘by — Paris’ may be
briefly rendered by +von den Parisern+, which place immediately after the
conjunction ‘and’.

[4] ‘to bury’, here = to veil, +umhüllen+; the prep. ‘in’ must then be
rendered by +mit+.

[5] is high = blows violently.

[6] since the copula ‘is’ was changed into another verb in the previous
clause, it must be inserted here.

[7] The literal version of this clause would not read well. I propose
to use the following construction: it is (Comp. N. 19) for the moment
impossible to embark.

[8] runaways = fugitives.

[9] is with them, +ist ihnen hold+ (propitious).

[10] to escape capture, +der Verhaftung entgehen+; to put to sea, +in die
See stechen+.

[11] +glücklich+; ‘shores’, here +Gestade+.

[12] +Inzwischen+, which place after the copula ‘has’. The verb ‘to
happen’ is conjugated with +sein+.

[13] to give way = to yield, conj. with +sein+; handful, +Häuflein+.

[14] +Aufruhr+ m.; rioter, +Aufrührer+.

[15] but = only; individuals = persons.

[16] a particle of = a little.

[17] +deren wir schon erwähnten.+

[18] All _the_ others in the city.

[19] were — King = ‘were just as faithless towards themselves as they
were towards the King’, and insert the grammatical subject +es+ after
the pronoun ‘they’.—=The grammatical subject +es+ is frequently employed
for emphasizing the real subject or to give more tone and like to the
construction=; as—+Es sprach die Leidenschaft aus seinen Zügen.+ It is,
moreover, used with all impersonal verbs; as—+es friert+, +es donnert+,
+es giebt+, +es ist+.




_Section 105._

THE DRAMA OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1848.

V.


Princes, peers[1], soldiers, and statesmen were all sneaking[2] in
hiding places whilst the capital was[3] made over to the mercy of a few
dozen incendiaries. The daughter-in-law, seeing (S. 55, N. 1) the King
depart[4], carries[5] her child to the Chamber of Deputies[6], and[7]
there, with womanly courage and queenly dignity, vindicates his rights.
Her friends entreat her to withdraw. Firm[8] in her purpose, she does
not move[9] an inch. She attempts to speak, but is interrupted; and[10]
he who interrupts is himself silenced by an armed mob that pours[11]
into the hall[12]. The Duchess is forced away[13], and in that terrible
extremity _is_ separated from her son. The child is seized by (S. 106,
N. 23) a rough hand, which[14] is strong enough to strike[15], but[16]
generous enough to save. The boy is brought[17] to his mother, and
mother and son pass[18] from asylum to asylum, chased[19] by scythes,
sabres, muskets, and, worse[20] than all, the[21] bloody passions of
an infuriated “canaille”. For[22] four days they[23] creep into hiding
places; on the fifth day they are beyond the frontier.

[1] The Peers of France were called ‘Pairs’, which term is used in
German, the final +s+ being pronounced.

[2] to sneak into hiding places, +in den Winkel kriechen+.

[3] was made over = was left (+überlas´sen+), with the dat. Construe the
sentence after the following model:—+Die Festung wurde einer kleinen
Anzahl Soldaten auf Gnade oder Ungnade überlassen.+

[4] +davon´reisen.+ Comp. App. § 19.

[5] +führen+, before which the subjective pronoun ‘she’ must be supplied.

[6] +Deputiertenkammer+, f.

[7] and — rights = where she vindicates his rights with, etc.

[8] +Fest ihren Zweck verfolgend.+

[9] +zurück´weichen.+

[10] and — himself, +und der sie Unterbrechende selbst wird+.

[11] to pour = to rush.

[12] +Saal+, m.

[13] +gewaltsam hinweg´drängen+.

[14] After the rel. pron. insert the adverb +zwar+ (certainly, it is
true, indeed), which will give more force to the clause.

[15] +darein´zuschlagen.+

[16] ‘but’, here +doch+, or +aber auch+.

[17] ‘to bring’, here = to bring back.

[18] ‘to pass’, here = to flee.

[19] chased = pursued; by, +von+.

[20] what is still worse.

[21] +von dem blutgierigen Zorn eines rasenden Pöbels.+

[22] +Vier Tage lang+.

[23] they — places = they try to conceal themselves.




_Section 106._

THE DRAMA OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1848.

VI.


Everybody is escaping at[1] the same moment. There is the King’s eldest
son, pale and half-naked, throwing[2] aside his tinsel and putting on
fustian, looking[3] less than a man in his fear, trembling with[4]
emotion, and finally running[5] like a madman for[6] his life. There are
your[7] ministers, of[8] European reputation and wisdom unapproachable,
bounding[9] like antelopes, northwards[10], southwards, “anywhere,
anywhere[11] out of the city”, which they and all the rest give up[12]
to indiscriminate riot. And[13] now the crowning point of our first
“tableau” is near. The (S. 107, N. 13) mob, masters[14] of Paris, are
sacking the Tuileries. The choicest moveables[15] are broken to atoms; a
group[16] takes[17] the places which Royalty filled a moment ago at the
breakfast table; others are in the wine cellar drinking[18] themselves
ten times drunk; others, again[19], are in the Queen’s apartments,
defiling[20] that[21] domestic sanctuary. Outside the palace and on the
top[22] of it a flag is waved[23] by[24] a dozen men, whose[25] shouts
and shrieks invite hundreds, whom[26] you see crawling up with no earthly
object but immediately to (S. 19, N. 7) slide down again.

[1] at — moment = with them.

[2] ‘throwing — life’. The rendering of this passage according to
the rule of S. 16, N. 4 would be inelegant, since there are a number
of Present Participles following one another. I propose, therefore,
to begin a new period here, saying: He throws aside his tinsel (here
+Flitterstaat+, m.), puts on fustian, etc.; to put on fustian, +sich in
Barchent kleiden+.

[3] to look less than a man, +kaum einem Manne ähnlich sehen+.

[4] +vor+; emotion = excitement.

[5] +davon´laufen.+

[6] +um sein Leben zu retten.+

[7] your = the.

[8] of — unapproachable = incomparable in (+an+) European fame and wisdom.

[9] Since a relative clause follows immediately, it would be bad taste
to render this clause, beginning with a Present Participle, in the same
form. It will be best to commence a new period. Comp. N. 2.

[10] +nach Nord und Süd.+

[11] The second ‘anywhere’ is best turned by +nur hinweg+.

[12] +dem allgemeinen Aufruhr preisgeben.+

[13] And — near = And now we approach (+sich nähern+, with Dat.) the end
(+Schluß+, m.) of our first tableau. The French ‘tableau’ is used with
French pronunciation in the same sense in German. It is of the neuter
gender and takes the inflection of an +s+ in the Gen. Sing.

[14] masters of Paris = which rules _in_ Paris; to rule, +beherrschen+
(v. tr.).

[15] moveables = objects; atoms = pieces.

[16] Insert the noun ‘men’.

[17] +ein´nehmen+; Royalty = the Royal family; filled = occupied (+inne
haben+, treated like a comp. sep. v.). The adverbial clause ‘at the
breakfast table’ is best placed after the verb ‘takes’.

[18] drinking themselves drunk = and drink themselves drunk (+sich
betrinken+).

[19] +wiederum andere.+

[20] and defile (+besudeln+).

[21] +diese geheiligte Stätte der Häuslichkeit.+

[22] top = roof; of it = of the same.

[23] +hin und her schwenken.+

[24] =The preposition ‘by’ in connection with the passive voice and
establishing a relation with the noun or pronoun that denotes the doer of
the action expressed by the verb, is rendered by +von+.=

[25] To avoid a succession of relative clauses, which should always be
avoided, begin again a new period here and say: The shouts and shrieks of
these men invite (+herbei´locken+), etc.

[26] whom — but = who seem only to climb up (+erklettern+) the roof. The
adv. ‘immediately’ comes after the conjunction ‘to’.




_Section 107._

THE DRAMA OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION OF 1848.

VII.


There[1] is sentiment in all things. The apartments of the poor
daughter-in-law are reached (S. 4, N. 4, +man+), but, strange[2] to say,
are respected[3] in the midst of the work[4] of general destruction.
Her children’s toys are[5] not even touched; the hat and (S. 10, N. 9)
whip of her dead[6] husband are[7] still sacred; the books (S. 16, N.
10) she had been reading lie still open[8]. It[9] is an incident that
cannot fail to[10] elicit rounds of applause. And whilst[11] anarchy and
destruction prevail here, there[12] is equal confusion and danger in the
Chamber of Deputies. We have seen the[13] mob forcing their way into
(+zu+) that deliberative assembly. Everybody[14] is now rushing to the
tribune. Three[15] speakers become marked from the rest; their[16] names
are Lamartine[23], Crémieux[23], and Ledru Rollin[23]; they[17]
gain the popular ear, and undertake (S. 51, N. 13) to establish[18]
order—a superhuman responsibility! A Provisional Government is announced,
named[19], and approved on the spot. “To (S. 72, N. 4) the Hôtel de
Ville!” exclaims one[20]. “To the Hôtel de Ville!” respond _a_ hundred;
and amidst[21] yells and hootings, cries[22] of “Vive la République!”
“Vive Lamartine!” “A bas tout le monde!” _Monsieur_ Lamartine[23] sets
out for that celebrated building, followed by a train made[24] up of the
dregs of a seething metropolis. In the middle[25] of the shouting the
curtain falls, and[26] the first act terminates. Search[27] the dramatic
annals of the world for such another.—ESSAYS FROM “THE TIMES”.

[1] +Es findet sich jedoch überall noch eine Spur von Gefühl.+

[2] strange to say, +sonderbarerweise+.

[3] are respected, +werden dieselben ... verschont+.

[4] work — destruction, +allgemeines Zerstörungswerk+.

[5] +bleiben+; not touched = untouched.

[6] +verstorben.+

[7] +sind dem Andenken noch heilig.+

[8] Supply here the adverb +da+, which will make the sentence more
emphatic.

[9] It is, +Es ist dies+. Comp. S. 104, N. 19.

[10] to — applause, +den allgemeinsten Beifall hervorzurufen.—Dieser
Vorfall erklärt sich durch die große Popularität des verstorbenen Herzogs
und seiner Gemahlin, der Herzogin Helene von Orléans.+

[11] Place the adv. ‘here’ after whilst, and use the adverb +noch+ with
it.

[12] ‘there is’, here +findet man+, after which place ‘in — Deputies’.

[13] the — way = how the mob forces its way (+sich einen Weg bahnen+).
=In German the verb agrees in the Singular with a collective substantive
in the Singular.=

[14] +Alles+; to, +auf+.

[15] +Drei Redner hört man über die andern hinaus.+

[16] +sie heißen.+

[17] they = these; to gain the popular ear, +sich beim Volke Gehör
verschaffen+.

[21] +unter.+

[22] +und unter wiederholten Ausrufen von ...+

[23] ‘to set out’, here +die Prozession an´treten+; for, +nach+. The
verb must of course appear before the Subject Lamartine. +~Louis
Alphonse Lamartine~ erregte zunächst durch seine zarten Jugenddichtungen
in den zwanziger Jahren allgemeine Aufmerksamkeit. Nachdem er durch
den Tod eines Oheims ein bedeutendes Vermögen ererbt hatte, bereiste
er 1832 den Orient, worauf er die politische Laufbahn betrat und
einer der glänzendsten Redner der Deputiertenkammer wurde. Nach der
Februarrevolution von 1848 wurde er Mitglied der provisorischen Regierung
und Minister des Auswärtigen, zog sich jedoch 1851 unzufrieden zurück
und † am 1. März 1869 zu Passy, wo er in dürftigen Verhältnissen
gelebt hatte. ~Isaac Adolphe Crémieux~, Israelit, wurde 1830 Advokat
am Kassationshofe zu Paris, bekämpfte, seit 1842 Mitglied der Kammer,
heftig das Ministerium Guizot und förderte die Reformbewegung. Nach der
Februarrevolution von 1848 ward er Mitglied der provisorischen Regierung,
in der er kurze Zeit das Justizministerium bekleidete. Nach der Wahl
des Prinzen Louis Napoléon zum Präsidenten trat er zur Opposition
über, ward beim Staatsstreich am 2. Dez. 1851 verhaftet, jedoch bald
wieder freigelassen, worauf er sich auf seine Praxis beschränkte. Im
Jahre 1870, nach dem Sturze des Kaiserreichs, nochmals zum Mitglied der
provisorischen Regierung gewählt, hielt er sich zu Gambetta und ward
später Mitglied der Nationalversammlung. ~Alexandre Auguste Ledru Rollin~
ward Advokat, und trat 1844 in die Kammer der Deputierten, nachdem er als
Advokat in vielen politischen Prozessen plaidiert hatte. Er beteiligte
sich lebhaft bei der Reformagitation von 1847, ward 1848 Mitglied der
provisorischen Regierung und Minister des Innern, trat jedoch schon im
Juni desselben Jahres von der Regierung zurück. Im Juni 1849 mußte er
wegen politischer Intriguen nach England fliehen, ward abwesend zur
Deportation verurteilt und lebte seitdem als Mitglied des dortigen
Revolutionskomitees in London. Im Jahre 1857 wurde er mit Mazzini eines
Komplots gegen Napoleon III. eingeklagt und abermals verurteilt, und
kehrte endlich am 26. März 1870 infolge der Erklärung der Republik
und der Amnestie nach Paris zurück, ohne sich aber an den dortigen
Ereignissen hervorragend zu beteiligen.+

_Section 108._

EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER[1].


A French student of (S. 3, N. 2) medicine lodged[2] in the same house in
London with a man in a fever. This poor man was constantly plagued by
the nurse to drink, though[3] he nauseated the insipid liquids that were
presented to him. At last, when she[4] grew more and more importunate, he
whispered in her (S. 43, N. 9, _B_) ear:—“For[5] God’s sake bring me a
salt herring, and I will drink as much _as_ you please[6]!”

The woman indulged[7] him in his request; he devoured the herring, drank
plentifully, underwent[8] a copious perspiration, and recovered[9].

The French student inserted this aphorism[10] in his journal[11]:—“A salt
herring cures[12] an Englishman in a fever.”

On[13] his return to (S. 72, N. 4) France he prescribed the same remedy
to the first patient in a fever[2] to whom he was called.

The patient died; on which[14] the student inserted[15] in his journal
_the_ following note:—“N.B. Though a salt herring cures an Englishman,
it[16] kills a Frenchman.”—W. C. HAZLITT, ANECDOTES.

[11] Form a comp. n. of ‘day’ and ‘book’ according to S. 76, N. 22, _C_.

ON[1] SELF CULTURE.

(From[2] an address delivered to an assemblage of young men at Edinburgh.)


I[3] stand before you a self-educated man. My education was[4] that
which was supplied at the humble parish schools of Scotland; and _it
was_ only[5] when I[6] went to Edinburgh, a poor boy, _that_ I devoted
my evenings, after the labours of the day, to the cultivation of[7] that
intellect which the Almighty has given me. From seven or eight in the
morning till nine or ten at night[8], was I at[9] _my_ business as _a_
bookseller’s apprentice[10], and[11] _it was_ only during hours after
these, stolen from sleep, _that_ I could devote myself to study. I assure
you that I did not read novels[12]; my attention was devoted[13] to
physical science and other useful matters[14]. During[15] that period I
taught myself French. I look back[16] to that time with great pleasure,
and am almost sorry I have not to go[17] through the same troubles again.
I[18] reaped more pleasure when I had not a sixpence in my pocket,
studying in a garret in Edinburgh, than I now find when sitting amidst
all the elegancies and comforts of a parlour.—WILLIAM CHAMBERS.

[1] +Über Selbstbildung.+

‘You see before you a man who has educated himself’ (+sich selbst bilden
or aus´bilden+).

[4] was — Scotland = was such as (it) (+eine solche, wie sie+) is given
(+erteilen+) at (_in_) a simple Scottish village-school.

[5] =The adverb ‘only’, when used in reference to time, is turned by
‘+erst+’, but in references to number by ‘+nur+’=; as—

    It is _only_ one o’clock.

    +Es ist ~erst~ ein Uhr.+

GOETHE’S[1] DEATH.

I.


The[2] following morning—it was the 22nd March 1832—he tried to[3] walk a
little up and down the room, but[4] after a turn, he found[5] himself too
feeble to continue. Reseating[6] himself in the easy chair, he chatted
cheerfully with Ottilie [(S. 53, N. 9) his daughter-in-law] on[7] the
approaching spring, which would[8] be sure to restore him. He[9] had no
idea of his end being so near. The name _of_ Ottilie was frequently on
his lips. She sat beside him, holding[10] his hand in both of hers. It
was now observed that his thoughts began to wander[11] incoherently.
“See,” he exclaimed, “the lovely woman’s head, with black curls, in
splendid colours—a[12] dark background!” Presently[13] he saw a piece of
paper on the floor, and asked _them_ how[14] they could leave Schiller’s
letters so carelessly lying about. Then[15] he slept softly, and, on[16]
awakening, asked[17] for the sketches[18] (S. 16, N. 10) he had just
seen—the[19] sketches of his dream.

[1] +~Johann Wolfgang von Göthe~, geboren den 22. August 1749 zu
Frankfurt a/M., gestorben den 22. März 1832 zu Weimar, kann wohl
mit Recht der universalste Genius seiner Zeit genannt werden, deren
Litteratur er unbestritten beherrschte. Er war Dichter, Biograph,
Naturforscher, Altertumsforscher, Kritiker, Ästhetiker und Staatsmann. In
fast allen poetischen Gattungen zeigte er sich als vollendeter Künstler,
am bedeutendsten aber war er als Lyriker. Er hinterließ einen einzigen
Sohn, dessen Frau (Ottilie) unten erwähnt wird.+

[2] +Am nächsten Morgen.+

[3] +im Zimmer auf- und ab´gehen.+

[4] but — turn = but already after _a_ few steps.

[5] +sich fühlen+; ‘to continue’ may be briefly rendered by +dazu+.

[6] After he had seated himself again, etc.

[7] +über+.

[8] would be sure = would surely (see App. §§ 28 and 30).

[9] He — near = He had no idea of it (+davon+), that his end was so near.

[10] +und hielt seine Hand mit beiden Händen umschlossen+.

[11] +umher´irren+.

[12] a = upon a.

[13] Then.

_Section 111._

GOETHE’S DEATH.

II.


In silent anguish they[1] now awaited the close now so surely approaching
(S. 48, N. 6). His speech was becoming less and less distinct. The last
words audible[2] were: “More Light!” The final[3] darkness[4] grew apace,
and he[5] whose eternal longings had been for more light, gave a parting
cry for it as he was passing under the shadow of death.

He continued to express himself by signs, drawing[6] letters[7] with his
forefinger in the air, while he[8] had strength, and finally, as life
(S. 3, N. 2) ebbed[9], drawing[10] figures slowly on the shawl which
covered his legs. At[11] half-past twelve he composed[12] himself in the
corner of the easy chair. His faithful watcher[13] placed a finger on
her lips to intimate that he was asleep[14]. It was a sleep in which a
life glided[15] from the world. He[16] woke no more.—G. H. LEWES, LIFE OF
GOETHE.

[1] they = his friends, +die Seinen+.

[2] In ordinary prose adjectives qualifying a noun should precede it.

[3] final = last.

[4] +Dunkel+ (n.) +stieg hernieder+.

[5] he — death = he who had always longed (+sich sehnen+) for (+nach+)
more light, cried still parting for it (+danach+) when the night of death
overshadowed him.

[6] =The conjunction +indem+ with a finite verb is frequently employed
for rendering the English Participle in -ing used in adverbial clauses of
manner=; as—

    _Supporting_ himself on her arm he slowly ascended the stairs.

    +~Indem~ er sich auf ihren Arm ~stützte~, stieg er langsam die
    Treppe hinauf.+

[7] +Buchstaben+, which place after ‘forefinger’.

[8] After ‘he’ insert the adverb +noch+.

[9] +dahin´fluten+.

[10] drew he slowly figures (+Zahlen+), etc.

[11] +Um halb eins.+

[12] to compose oneself in the corner, +sich ruhig in die Ecke
zurück´legen+.

[13] +Wärterin.+

[14] Use the Present of the Subj. App. § 28 and § 30.

[15] +scheiden+; from, +aus+.

[16] Say ‘Goethe’ instead of ‘he’; woke = awoke; no more, +nicht wieder+.




_Section 112._

ON TRAVELLING (S. 3, N. 2).


I[1] wish folks[2] in general would keep their eyes a little more open
when they travel by rail[3]. When I see young people rolling along in a
luxurious[4] carriage, absorbed (S. 102, N. 3) in a trashy[5] shilling
novel[6], and[7] never lifting up their eyes to look out of the window,
unconscious[8] of all that[9] they are passing;—of[10] the reverend
antiquities, the admirable[11] agriculture, the rich _and_ peaceful
scenery[12], the[13] like of which no other country upon earth can show
(App. § 18); unconscious[14], too, _of_ how much they might[15] learn
_of_ botany _and_ geology, by[16] simply watching the flowers along
the railway banks, and the sections[17] in the cuttings[18];—then it
grieves me to see what[19] little use people make of the eyes and the
understanding which God has given them. They complain of[20] a dull[21]
journey: but[22] it is not the journey which is dull; it[23] is they who
are dull. Eyes[24] have they, and see not; ears have they, and hear not;
mere[25] dolls in smart clothes, too many of them, like the idols of the
heathen.—CHARLES KINGSLEY, TOWN GEOLOGY.

[1] +Ich möchte wohl.+

[2] Say ‘(the) people (+die Leute+) would use (Imperf. Subj. of
+brauchen+, App. § 32) in general the eyes a little more’, etc.

[3] +mit der Eisenbahn reisen.+

[4] luxurious = splendid; for the rendering of the verbs in this passage
consult S. 78, N. 14, and for their position, App. § 19; to roll along,
+dahin´rollen+.

[5] +schlecht.+

[6] Form comp. n. according to S. 76, N. 22, _B_.

[7] and — eyes = so that they never lift up their eyes. This constr. is
necessary to avoid a repetition of participles.

[8] +nichts ahnend.+

[9] +woran sie vorüberfahren.+

[10] Say ‘nothing of’.

[11] excellent.

[12] landscape.

[13] the — which = as, +wie sie+ (grammatical object); comp. S. 51, N. 13.

[14] +auch nicht einmal ahnend.+

[15] I might learn much of botany, +ich könnte viel Botanik lernen+. The
subject ‘they’ place after ‘geology’ and before the two verbs.

[16] by — watching = if they would only watch (+beobachten+); along —
banks = on (+an+) the sides of the railway.

[17] +Bahnprofil+, n.

[18] +Durchstich+, m. The two verbs must, of course, stand at the end of
the whole passage.

[19] +wie wenig+, little (denoting quantity).

[20] +über+, with Acc.

[21] dull = wearisome, +langweilig+.

[22] but — dull = but not the journey is dull.

[23] +sie selbst sind es+ (Comp. S. 104, N. 19).

[24] The inverted constr. would not read well here; use therefore the
ordinary constr.

[25] are nothing but (+als+) dolls in fine clothes, and like (+gleich+,
with Dat.) the idols (+Götzenbilder+) of the heathens are _there_ too
many of them (+sind ihrer zu viele+).




_Section 113._

THE MANAGEMENT[1] OF THE BODY.


I have nothing new to say upon the management which the body requires[2].
The common rules are the best:—exercise without fatigue; generous[3]
living without excess; early rising, and moderation in sleeping. These
are the apothegms[4] of old women; but if they are not attended to[5],
happiness[6] becomes (App. § 15) so extremely difficult that[7] very few
_persons_ can attain[8] to it. In[9] this point of view, the care[10] of
the body becomes a[11] subject of elevation and importance. A walk in
the fields, an hour’s[12] less sleep, may[13] remove all these bodily
vexations[14] and disquietudes which are such formidable enemies to[15]
virtue; they may enable[16] the mind[17] to pursue[18] its own resolves
without that constant train[19] of temptations to resist, and[20]
obstacles to overcome, which[21] it always experiences from the bad
organisation of its companion.—SIDNEY SMITH.

_Section 114._

THE SOURCES[1] OF WATER.


There[2] are many sources of water. The first great source[3] is the
ocean, which collects all _the_ water from[4] the earth; this water
contains so large a quantity _of_ salt, that none[5] of us can drink
it. The sun, however, bears[6] down upon the ocean’s surface, and its
heating[7] rays penetrating[8] the water, combine, as[9] it were, with
it (S. 4, N. 5, _B_), and[10] raise it up. The atmosphere (S. 5, N.
2), like[11] a sponge, absorbs the[12] vaporous water, carrying[13] it
from the Equator to[14] the Arctic and the Antarctic regions; thus[15]
distributing it north and south. It then condenses in the form of rain
and _of_ snow. When it sinks into the earth and pours down the[16]
mountain sides, it forms springs and rivulets, entering[17] (S. 16, N.
4) the ocean again in[18] the form of rivers. Man catches[19] it in tubs
and cisterns, draws[20] it from[21] the rivers, or digs down[22] into
the earth, and catches[23] it as it passes[24] along beneath his feet.
Thus[25] we have rain water, river water, and spring or well water.—DR.
LANKESTER.

[1] Here +Urquellen+.

[2] The water has many sources.

[3] great = chief; form a comp. n.

[4] To render ‘from the’ use the Gen. of the def. art.

[5] none of us = nobody.

principle stated there applying likewise to other compound expressions
besides nouns.

[16] the = on (+an+) the.

[17] to enter again the ocean, +dem Ozean wieder zuströmen+.

[23] +sammeln.+

[24] ‘to pass along’, here +dahin´fließen+.

[25] +Auf diese Weise.+




_Section 115._

THE ART OF ORATORY.


I[1] owe my success in life to one single fact[2], namely:—At[3] the age
of twenty-seven[4] I commenced, and continued for years, the process of
daily speaking (S. 34, N. 10) upon the contents of some historical or
scientific book. These efforts[5] were made sometimes in a corn-field[6],
at others[7] in the forest, and not unfrequently in some distant[8] barn,
with[9] _the_ horse and ox for my auditors. It[10] is this early practice
in the _great_ art of all arts that I am indebted for the primary and
leading impulses that stimulated me forward, and shaped and moulded my
entire subsequent[11] destiny. Improve[12], then, the superior advantages
(S. 16, N. 10) you here enjoy[13]. Let not[14] a day pass[15] without
exercising (S. 34, N. 10) your powers[16] of speech. There is (S. 82, N.
7) no power like[17] that of oratory. Cæsar controlled[18] men by[19]
exciting their fears; Cicero[20] by[21] captivating their affection and
swaying their passions. The influence of the one perished[22] with its
author; that of the other continues[23] to this day.—HENRY CLAY[24].

[1] To avoid beginning with the pronoun ‘=I=’, which seldom looks well in
German, and is considered bad style in letters, place the object first,
and construe according to App. § 14.

[2] =fact = deed or action = +That+=, f.; =fact = event= (as in this
instance) = +=Thatsache=+, f.; =the Latin +Factum+=, pl. =+Facta+ or
+Facten+ is, however, used in both significations=.

[3] At the, +Im+.

[4] Supply ‘years’, and construe thus: I began the process (+Verfahren+,
n.), which I continued for years (+jahrelang+) to speak daily about
(+über+, with Acc.), etc.; some = a.

[5] efforts = exercises.

[6] Here place the verb.

[7] +zuweilen.+

[8] +entlegen.+

[9] whereby horse and ox formed my audience (+Zuhörer+).

[10] It — forward = To this early practice ... I owe the first
and leading impulses (+Triebfedern+) which urged me forward
(+vor´wärtstreiben+, sep. comp. str. v.).

[11] subsequent = later.

[12] Improve = Use, which use in the 2nd pers. pl.; then = therefore;
superior = great.

[13] +genießen.+

[14] ‘Not’ in connection with the indef. art. must generally be rendered
by ‘no’.

[15] +vorü´bergehen.+

[16] +Redetalent+, n.

[17] +welche der der Beredsamkeit gleichkommt.+

[18] +beherrschen.+

[19] +durch Erregung+; render ‘their’ by the Gen. of the def. art.

[20] Supply here ‘controlled them’ (+beherrschte sie dadurch, daß er+
...). Comp. and read carefully S. 87, N. 6, and also S. 1, N. 3. The verb
+beherrschen+ requires the preposition +durch+.

[21] by — passions = that he gained (+sich gewinnen+) their love and
guided (+lenken+) their passions.

[22] +erstarb+; its author = the author of the same (to agree with
‘influence’).

[23] +fort´dauern+, sep. c. w. v.; to this day, +bis auf den heutigen
Tag+.

[24] +~Henry Clay~ (geb. 1777 in Virginien, † 1852 in Washington) war
ein amerikanischer Staatsmann, welcher sich als Sohn eines einfachen
Landmannes bis zu den höchsten Ämtern des Staats heraufarbeitete; 1824
ward er zum Staatssekretär des Auswärtigen ernannt und 1829 war er unter
Jacksons Präsidentschaft im Kongreß Führer der Opposition, als welcher er
die Schutzzölle und die Nationalbank verteidigte. Im Jahre 1849 brachte
er den Kompromiß zustande, wonach dem Süden das Recht der Verfolgung
flüchtiger Sklaven durch das Gebiet der Union eingeräumt ward.+




_Section 116._

EARLY PRIVATIONS[1].


Admiral Jervis, Earl of St. Vincent, tells us the[1] story of his early
struggles, and, among[2] other things, of his determination (S. 1, N.
2) to[3] keep out of debt. “My father had a very large family,” said
he, “with limited means. He gave me twenty pounds (S. 58, N. 3) at[4]
starting, and that was all (S. 3, N. 7) he ever[5] gave me. After I had
been a considerable time at[6] the station at sea I[7] drew for twenty
more, but the bill came[8] back protested. I[9] was mortified[10] at this
rebuke, and made[11] a promise, which I have ever[12] kept, that[13]
I would never draw another bill without[14] a certainty of its being
paid. I immediately changed my mode of living, quitted[15] my mess[16],
lived[17] alone, and[18] took up the ship’s allowance, which I found
quite sufficient; washed and mended[19] my own clothes; made a pair _of_
trousers out _of_ the ticking of my bed[20], and, having (S. 55, N. 1)
by[21] these means saved as much money as[22] would redeem my honour, I
took[23] up my bill. From (S. 102, N. 4) that time to this I[24] have
taken care to[25] keep within my means.”

Jervis (S. 5, N. 2) for six years endured pinching[26] privation, but
preserved his integrity, studied his profession with success, and
gradually rose[27] by merit and bravery to the highest rank.—S. SMILES,
SELF-HELP.

[1] Early Privations, +Jugendentbehrungen+; the story — struggles. This
passage, literally rendered, is not clear in German, and should be turned
thus: of (+von+) the struggles with privations, which he had to go
through (+bestehen+), when he was a youth (+als Jüngling+, which place
after the subject ‘he’).

[2] among other things = +unter anderem+.

[3] +sich von Schulden freihalten.+

[4] at starting, +beim Beginn meiner Laufbahn+; see App. § 9.

[5] +je+; for the position of the pronoun ‘me’ see App. § 9, and use the
verb in the Perfect, omitting, however, the auxiliary according to App. §
22.

[6] +auf meinem Posten zur See.+

[7] I — more = I drew another (+noch ein+) bill of twenty pounds. To draw
a bill, +einen Wechsel ziehen+.

[8] to come back protested, +mit Protest wieder zurück´kommen+.

[9] I felt (+sich fühlen+).

[10] mortified = humbled, +gedemütigt+; at, +durch+.

[11] ‘to make a promise’, here +ein Gelübde ablegen+.

[12] ever = always, +stets+.

[13] that — bill. This clause is best changed into a shortened
subordinate clause in form of a supine: never to draw a bill again. Place
‘again’ after ‘never’.

[14] without — paid, +ohne auch sicher zu sein, daß man ihn honorieren
würde+.

[15] ‘To quit’, here to give up.

[16] +Offizierstisch.+

[17] To live, equivalent to _reside_ or _dwell_, is generally rendered by
+=wohnen=+; but equivalent to _exist_ is rendered by +=leben=+.

[18] +und hielt mich an die Schiffsrationen+; quite, +durchaus+.

[19] here +flicken+.

[20] bed = bed-covering; Comp. n. S. 36, N. 7, _A_.

[21] by these means = in (+auf+) this manner.

[22] as — honour = in order to redeem (+wieder ein´lösen+) my honour.

[23] to take up one’s bill, +seinen Wechsel bezahlen+.

[24] Say ‘I have always endeavoured’.

[25] to keep within one’s means, +nicht über seine Mittel hinaus leben+;
for six years, +sechs Jahre lang+.

[26] We would use the superlative here; pinching, +drückend+.

[27] ‘to rise’, here +empor´steigen+; to, +bis zu+, contracted with the
Dat. of the def. art.




_Section 117._

THE BLESSEDNESS[1] OF FRIENDSHIP.

I.


A[2] blessed thing it is for any[3] man or (S. 10, N. 9) woman to have
a friend; one human soul whom we can trust utterly; a friend who knows
the best and the worst[4] of us, and who loves us, in spite of all our
faults; who will[5] speak the honest[6] truth to us, while the world
flatters us to[7] our face, and laughs _at us_ behind our backs; who will
give[8] us counsel and reproof in the days of (S. 3, N. 2) prosperity and
self-conceit; but[9] who, again, will comfort and encourage us in the
days of difficulty[10], and sorrow, when the world leaves[11] us alone
to[12] fight our _own_ battle as we can.

If we have had the _good_ fortune to win such a friend, let us do
anything[13] rather[14] than lose him. We must give and forgive; live and
let live. If our friend have[15] faults, we must bear[16] with them (S.
4, N. 5, _B_). We must hope all _things_, believe all _things_, endure
all _things_, rather[17] than lose that most precious of all earthly
possessions—a trusty[18] friend.

[1] +Segen+, m.

[2] It is a blessing.

[3] every.

[4] Superlative of +schlimm+.

[5] will speak = always speaks. Use the Present likewise with the
following verbs in this passage.

[6] +aufrichtig.+

[7] +ins Gesicht.+

[8] to give counsel and reproof to a person, +einem mit Rat und Tadel zur
Seite stehen+; self-conceit, +Selbsttäuschung+, f.—The adverbial clause
‘in the days — conceit’ stands after the rel. pron. and the Dat. ‘us’
(App. § 9).

[9] but — again, +der uns aber auch+.

[10] +Prüfung.+

[11] ‘to leave a person alone’, here +einen imstich lassen+.

[12] +und wir unsern Kampf, so gut wir können, allein auszufechten haben.+

[13] all.

[14] +um ihn nur nicht zu verlieren.+

[15] has.

[16] to bear a thing, +Geduld mit etwas haben+.

[17] +lieber+, which place before the last ‘all’.

[18] +zuverlässig.+




_Section 118._

THE BLESSEDNESS OF FRIENDSHIP.

II.


_And_ a friend once won (S. 7, N. 3, _A_) need[1] never be lost, if we
will only be trusty and true ourselves. Friends may[2] part, not merely
in body, but in spirit, for a while. In the bustle of (S. 3, N. 2)
business and the accidents of life, they may lose[3] sight of each other
for years (S. 115, N. 4); and[4] more—they[5] may begin to differ in
their success in life, in their opinions, in their habits, and _there_
may be, for a time[6], coldness and estrangement between them: but not
for ever, if each will be but trusty and true.

For then[7], according to[8] the beautiful figure of the poet, they will
be like two ships which set sail[9] at morning from the same port, _and_
ere[10] nightfall lose sight of each other, and[11] go each on its own
course, and at its own pace, for many days, through many storms and seas;
and[12] yet meet again, and[13] find themselves lying side by side in the
same haven, when the long voyage is past.—CHARLES KINGSLEY, “THE WATER OF
LIFE.”

[1] need — lost = we need (+brauchen+) never to lose.

[2] may = can, after which place the adverbial clause ‘for a while’,
+auf kurze Zeit+; the verb ‘part’, which is equivalent to ‘be separated’
should stand at the end of the whole passage; ‘in body’, +körperlich+;
‘in spirit’, +geistig+.

[3] to lose sight of each other, +sich aus dem Gesicht verlieren+.

[4] +ja noch mehr.+

[5] Say ‘it is possible that their success in life, their opinions, their
habits begin to differ (+differieren+)’.

[6] for a time, +eine Zeit lang+, which place after ‘and’; ‘may’, here
+mag+; ‘be’, here = exist, +bestehen+.

[7] Here follow copula and subject according to App. § 14.

[8] according to, +nach+; figure, +Bild+, n.; to be like, +gleichen+,
which governs the Dat.

[9] to set sail, +aus´segeln+.

[10] ere nightfall, +vor Dunkelwerden+.

[11] Say ‘and of which each through many storms and upon many seas
(+Meer+, n.) for days pursues its own course (+Richtung+, f.) and its own
pace (+Lauf+, m.)’.

[12] and — again, +welche aber dennoch wieder zusam´mentreffen+.

[13] Say ‘and find that they lie after the long voyage (+Seefahrt+, f.)
side by side (+neben einander+) in the same haven’.




_Section 119._

DO GOOD IN YOUR OWN SPHERE OF ACTION[1].

I.


“I want to be at work[2] in the world,” said Tom, “and not dawdling
away[3] three years at Oxford.”

“What do you mean[4] by ‘at work in the world?’” said the master, with[5]
his lips close to his saucerful of tea, and peering at Tom over it.

“Well, I mean real work; one’s[6] profession, whatever[7] one will really
have to do, and make one’s living by. I want to be doing some real good,
feeling (S. 30, N. 4) that I am not only at play[8] in the world,”
answered Tom, rather[9] puzzled to find out himself what he really did
mean.

“You are mixing up two very different things in your head, I[10] think,
Brown,” said the master, putting down[11] (S. 111, N. 6) the empty
saucer, “and you ought to get clear[12] about them (S. 4, N. 5, _B_).
You[13] talk of ‘working to get your living’ and ‘doing some real good in

[1] +Wirkungskreis+, m.; your = thy.

[2] to be at work = to do something.

[3] to dawdle away, +vergeuden+.

[6] +jemandes.+

[7] whatever (+das was+) one must really do to make one’s living (+seinen

[8] at play = for play (+zum Spielen+).

[9] Say ‘somewhat puzzled (+verlegen+) at (+über+) the meaning (+Sinn+,
m.) of his words’.

[10] The words ‘I think, Brown’ are best placed at the head of the
passage; Comp. S. 64, N. 11; to mix up, +vermengen+.

[11] +auf den Tisch stellen+.

[12] to get clear about a thing, +sich über etwas klar werden+. I cannot
get clear about that, +ich kann mir darüber nicht klar werden+;—ought =
should.

[13] Use the 2nd pers. sing., and read carefully S. 1, N. 3, and S. 87,
N. 6, which will enable you to construe this passage. The adverbial
clause ‘in the same breath’ (= in one breath) must be placed after the
predicate ‘talk’; to talk of a thing, +von etwas sprechen+.

DO GOOD IN YOUR OWN SPHERE OF ACTION.

II.


Now[1], you may be getting a good living in a profession, and yet doing
no good _at all_ in the world, but (S. 6, N. 10) quite[2] the contrary.
Keep[3] the latter before you as your one object, and you[4] will be
right whether you make a living[5] or not; but[6] if you dwell on the
other, you’ll very likely drop[7] into mere money-making, and let[8] the
world take care of itself, for good or evil. Don’t be in a hurry[9] about
finding your work in the world _for yourself_; you are not old enough to
(S. 19, N. 7) judge for yourself yet, but just[10] look about you in the
place you find yourself in, and try (S. 51, N. 13) to make things[11] a
little better and honester there. You’ll[12] find plenty to keep your
hand in at Oxford, or wherever else you [may] go. And[13] don’t be led
away to think this part of the world important, and that unimportant.
Every corner of the world is important. No man knows whether this _part_
or that part is[14] most so, but every man may[15] do some honest work in
his own corner.—THOMAS HUGHES, “TOM BROWN’S SCHOOL DAYS.”

[1] Now — getting, +Du kannst dir nun aber vielleicht ... verdienen+.

[2] quite = just, +gerade+.

[3] Say ‘Keep the last part of your sentence as your principal aim
(+Hauptzweck+, m.) before your eyes (+vor Augen+)’.

[4] Say ‘you will do right’.

[5] Insert +dabei+ after ‘living’.

[6] Say ‘but if you have only the other (to agree with ‘part’) before
your eyes’.

[7] to drop into mere money-making, +in bloße Geldmacherei verfallen+.

[8] to let the world take care of itself for good or evil, +die Welt im
Guten und im Bösen sich selbst überlassen+.

[9] to be in a hurry, +sich beeilen+; about finding = to find (S. 1, N.
3).

[10] ‘just’, here nur, which place after verb and pronoun; in the place,
+an der Stelle+; to find oneself, +sich befinden+.

[11] ‘things’, here = life, with def. art., after which place the adv.
‘there’; honester = more virtuous.

[12] The clause ‘at Oxford — go’ is best placed at the head of the whole
passage; to keep your hand in = to do.

[13] And — away, +Laß dich auch nicht dazu verleiten+; to think a thing
important, +eine Sache für wichtig halten+.

[14] is most so = is most important.—=When the superlative is used as
a predicate, it is generally preceded by +am+= (the preposition +an+
contracted with the definite article, dative case singular, masculine),
=and takes the dative termination +en+=; as—This matter is not important,
but that is _most important_, +diese Sache ist nicht wichtig, aber jene
ist ~am wichtigsten~+.

[15] may — corner = can in his own corner do _something_ good.

THE STATE[1] OF IRELAND.

(Conclusion of a Speech delivered[2] in the House of Commons in March
1868.)

I.


We must all endeavour to get[3] rid of passion in[4] discussing this
church question, which[5], I am sorry to say, is, of all others, the most
calculated to create passion. We are[6] all, I believe, of one religion.
I do not know (S. 51, N. 13), but I suppose there[7] will come a time in
the history of the world, when men will be astonished[8] that Catholic[9]
and Protestant, Churchman[10] and Nonconformist[11], had[12] so much
animosity and suspicion against each other.

I[13] _accept and_ believe in a very grand passage which I once met[14]
with in the writings of the illustrious founder of the colony and (S. 10,
N. 9) state _of_ Pennsylvania, that[15] “the humble[16], meek, merciful,
just, pious, and devout souls are[6] everywhere of[6] one religion;
and when death[17] (S. 3, N. 2) has taken off the mask, they will
know[18] one another, though the diverse liveries[19] they wear make[20]
them strangers.”

[1] +Zustand+, m.

[2] to deliver a speech, +eine Rede halten+. Construe according to S. 7,
N. 3, _A_; the House of Commons, +das Haus der Gemeinen+.

[3] to get rid of passion, +sich der Leidenschaftlichkeit enthalten+.

[4] in discussion = when we discuss (+besprechen+).

[5] +welche leider mehr als jede andere dazu angethan ist, die
Leidenschaften zu erregen.+

[6] are = have; of one = the same. Commence the passage with ‘I believe’.

[7] there — time, +es wird einst ... eine Zeit kommen+.

[8] to be astonished at a thing, +sich über etwas wundern+. Comp. S. 87,
N. 6.

[9] Use the pl. with this and the three following nouns.

[10] = members of the English Church.

[11] +Nonkonformisten.+

[12] to have animosity, +Feindschaft hegen+.

[13] Say ‘I believe in (+an+, with Acc.) _the_ following sublime
utterance (+Äußerung+, f.)’.

[14] met with = read.

[15] The passage ‘that — religion’ will be much improved by substituting
the adverb ‘+nämlich+:’ (viz.) for the conjunction ‘that’.

[16] +die Bescheidenen.+

[17] After ‘death’ insert the pron. ‘+ihnen+’, which will make the
reading much clearer; auxiliary ‘has’ may be omitted according to App. §
22.

[18] +sich einander erkennen.+

[19] Use the pl. of +Gewand+, n.

[20] make them strangers, +sie hienieden unter einander entfremden+.

Let us act in this spirit, and our work is[1] easy. The noble lord (S. 5,
N. 2), towards[2] the conclusion of his speech, spoke of the cloud which
is at present hanging[3] over Ireland. It is a dark and heavy cloud,
and its darkness expands[4] over the feelings of men in all parts of
the British Empire. But[5] there is a consolation that we may all take
to ourselves. An inspired king, bard, and prophet has left[6] us words
which[7] are not only the expression of a fact, but we may take them as
the utterance of a prophecy. He says: “To[8] the upright there arises
light in the darkness.”

Let us try in this matter to be upright[9]. Let us try to be just, and
that cloud will[10] be dispelled; the dangers which we see will vanish;
and we[11] may have the happiness of leaving[6] (S. 1, N. 3) to our
children the heritage of an honourable citizenship in a united and
prosperous[12] empire.—THE RIGHT HON. JOHN BRIGHT.

[1] is easy = will be easy for us (Dat. of persn. pron.).

[2] +an+, contr. with the dat. of the def. art.

[3] +schweben.+

[4] +sich erstre´cken.+

[5] Say ‘But one consolation we can all gather from it’. To gather,
+entnehmen+; from, aus. Read S. 4, N. 5, _B_.

[6] +hinterlassen+, insep. comp. str. v.

[7] Say ‘which not merely designate (+bezeichnen+) a fact (S. 115, N.
2), but (S. 6, N. 10) which we may (= can) also take (+hin´nehmen+) as a
prophecy (read App. § 18)’.

[8] “+Für den Gerechten erhebt sich ein Licht in der Finsternis+”.

[9] I think there is but the adj. ‘+gerecht+’ to render both ‘upright’
and ‘just’ in the underlying sense.

[10] +wird sich verteilen.+

[11] we may have = we shall perhaps have; happiness = joy.

[12] prosperous, +glücklich+; empire = state.

DR. GUTHRIE ON RAGGED SCHOOLS[1].

I.


The[2] interest I have been led to take in the Ragged School movement is
an example of how, in Providence, a man’s destiny—his course of life,
like that of a river—may be determined and affected by very trivial
circumstances. It is rather[3] curious—at least it is interesting for me
to[4] remember—that (S. 66, N. 15) _it was_ by a picture I was first[5]
led to take an interest in ragged schools—by a picture in an old,
obscure[6], decaying burgh[7] that stands on the shores of the Frith of
Forth, the birth-place (S. 53, N. 9) of[8] Thomas Chalmers. I went[9]
to see this place many years ago, and, going (S. 55, N. 1) into an inn
for[10] refreshment, I found the room covered (App. § 1) with pictures
of shepherdesses with their crooks, and sailors in[11] holiday attire,
not[12] particularly interesting. But above the chimney-piece there[13]
was a large print[14], more[15] respectable than its neighbours,
which[16] represented a cobbler’s room.

[1] +Doktor Guthrie über die Schulen für verwahrloste Kinder.—Sogenannte+
‘Ragged Schools’ +existieren in Deutschland wohl nicht, und zwar aus dem
einfachen Grunde, weil wir sie bisher nicht nötig hatten+.

[2] This passage requires an altogether different construction. Say ‘The
circumstances which led me (+welche mich dahin führten+) to interest
myself for the establishment of schools for neglected children, are an
example of (+davon+) how through Providence (+durch die Vorsehung+) the
fate of a man (+Mensch+)—his course of life (S. 76, N. 22, _B_, 1) like
(+gleich+, with dat.) that of a river—can be determined and affected
(+beeinflußt+) by very trivial (+geringfügig+) circumstances’. For the
position of the verbs read App. §§ 16-20.

[3] ‘rather’, here = not _a_ little.

[4] to remember, +mich daran zu erinnern+.

[5] +zuerst.+

[6] obscure = unknown.

[7] ‘burgh’, here +Flecken+, m.; the relat. clause ‘that — Forth’
may be elegantly rendered attributively, thus: +am Ufer des Frith of
Forth belegen+, which last word inflect correctly and place before the
qualified noun ‘burgh’.

[8] +von.+

[9] went to see = visited; place, +Ort+, m.; the adverbial clause of time
is best placed at the head of the passage.

[10] Say ‘to (= in order to) refresh myself’.

[11] in holiday attire, +im Festanzuge+.

[12] Insert ‘_which were_’.

[13] there was = hung.

[14] print, _Holzschnitt_, m.; or _Kupferstich_, m.

[15] Supply ‘which was’; ‘respectable’, here = tolerable, +erträglich+.

[16] Since we commenced the preceding clause with a relative pronoun,
it need not be repeated here. Substitute the conj. ‘and’ for ‘which’; a
cobbler’s room = the workshop of a cobbler.

The[1] cobbler was there himself, spectacles[2] on nose, an old shoe
between his (S. 43, N. 9) knees, the massive[3] forehead and firm mouth
indicating[4] great determination of character, and, beneath his bushy
eyebrows, benevolence[5] gleamed out on a number of poor ragged boys and
girls who stood at their lessons round the busy cobbler. My curiosity
was awakened; and in the inscription I read how this man, John Pounds,
a cobbler in Portsmouth, took[6] pity on the multitude of[7] poor
ragged children left[8] by ministers and magistrates, _and_ ladies and
gentlemen, to go to ruin in the streets—how[9], like a good shepherd,
he gathered in these wretched[10] outcasts—how he had trained[11] them
to God and the world—and how[12], while earning his daily bread by[13]
the sweat of his brow, he had rescued[14] from misery and saved to[15]
society not less than five hundred of these gentlemen[16]. I felt[17]
ashamed of myself. I[18] felt reproved for the little I had done. My
feelings[19] were touched. I was astonished at the man’s achievements;
and I[20] well remember, in[21] the enthusiasm of the moment, saying to
my companion (and I have seen in my cooler and calmer moments no reason
for[22] unsaying the saying): “That man is[23] an honour to humanity,
and deserves the greatest monument ever[24] raised within the shores of
Britain.”

[11] to train, +erzie´hen+; to, +für+.

[12] +und wie er sie, während er ... verdiente.+

[13] by — brow, +im Schweiße seines Angesichtes+, which place after
‘daily bread’.

[14] to rescue from misery, +aus dem Elend ziehen+. The auxiliary verb,
which must be used in the Subjunctive, according to App. §§ 28 and 30,
may be omitted in the intermediate clauses of this long period, and
placed but once at the end of the entire passage.

[15] Use the dat. of the def. art.

[16] The word ‘gentlemen’ is best used in its unaltered form in this
passage. It should be placed in inverted commas.

[17] to feel ashamed of oneself, +sich beschämt fühlen+.

[18] Say ‘The little (+was+) I had done was to me (+mir+) a reproach’.

[19] feelings = heart.

I[1] took up that man’s history, and _I_ found it animated by[2] the
spirit of[3] Him who[4] had “compassion on the multitude.” John Pounds
was a clever man besides[5]; and, like[6] Paul, if he could not win a
poor boy in (+auf+) any other way, he won him by art. He[7] would be seen
chasing a ragged boy along the quays, and compelling him to come to[8]
school, not by (+durch+) the power[9] of a policeman, but by the power of
a hot potato. He knew the love an[10] Irishman has for a potato; and[11]
John Pounds might be seen holding under a boy’s nose a _very_ hot potato,
and[12] wearing a coat as ragged as the boy himself wore. When the day
comes when[13] honour shall be done to whom honour is due[14], I[15] can
fancy the crowd of those whose fame poets (S. 3, N. 2) have sung[16], and
to whose memory monuments have been raised, dividing[17] like a wave,
and[18] passing the great, and the noble, and the mighty of the land,

_Section 127._

CHARACTER[1] OF CHARLEMAGNE.

I.


In[2] analyzing the character of heroes it is hardly possible to separate
altogether the[3] share of fortune from their own[4]. The epoch made[5]
by Charlemagne in the history of the world, the illustrious families
which[6] prided themselves in him as their progenitor, the[7] very
legends of romance, which are full of his fabulous exploits, have[8] cast
a lustre around his head, and testify[9] the greatness that has embodied
itself in his name. None[10], indeed, of Charlemagne’s wars can be
compared with the Saracenic victories of Charles Martel; but[11] that was
a contest for freedom, his for conquest; and[12] fame is more partial to
successful aggression than to patriotic resistance.

[1] Say ‘The character of Charles the Great (S. 53, N. 9)’. +~Karl der
Große~ König der Franken und später römischer Kaiser, wurde am 2. April
742, wahrscheinlich zu Aachen, geboren und war der Sohn ~Pipins des
Kleinen~ und der Enkel ~Karl Martells~, dessen Siege über die Sarazenen
in dieser Lektion erwähnt werden. Nach dem Tode seines königlichen Vaters
(768) trat er gemeinschaftlich mit seinem Bruder Karlmann die Regierung
an, ward aber schon im Jahre 771, durch den Tod seines Bruders und die
Ausschließung der Söhne desselben vom Throne, Alleinherrscher über alle
Franken, von den Pyrenäen bis zum Niederrhein und zum Meere, auch in
Deutschland über die Bayern, Thüringer und Alamannen. Durch zahlreiche
Kriege erweiterte er jedoch die Grenzen seines Reiches sehr bald, und
zwar nördlich bis zur Eider, südlich bis zum Ebro und nach Unteritalien,
und östlich bis zur Saale, dem Böhmerwalde und der Theiß, bis er im
Jahre 800 vom Papste Leo III. im St. Peters Dom zu Rom feierlich als
römischer Kaiser gekrönt wurde. Er starb am 28. Januar 814. In Karl dem
Großen, wie ihn die Geschichte mit Recht benannt hat, war der Begründer
der staatlichen Ordnung für die gesammte Germanenwelt erschienen. Seine
Lebensaufgabe, die ihm von Anfang an feststand, war, alle deutschen
Stämme in den ~einen~ fränkischen Reichsverband und in die ~eine~
christliche Kirche zusammenzufassen. Dem besten Teile nach ist sie ihm
gelungen, und so hat er der nachfolgenden Zeit, dem ganzen Mittelalter,
das Gepräge seines Geistes aufgedrückt. In niemand stellt sich die echt
deutsche Art der alten Zeit so herrlich dar, als in ihm. Als er die
Krone erhielt, zählte er erst 26 Jahre, stand also in der Kraft und
Blüte der Jugend. Er war von gewaltiger Körpergröße, eine Heldengestalt,
und von nicht minder gewaltiger Körperkraft, so daß er beim fröhlichen
Waidwerk den Kampf mit dem wilden Auerochsen in den Ardennenwäldern wie
ein Spiel aufnahm; überhaupt von jener Lust an Krieg und Gefahr, wie sie
den abenteuernden Heerkönigen der Völkerwanderung eigen gewesen war; in
den wichtigen Dingen der Welt von jener Härte und Rücksichtslosigkeit,
die noch keinem großen Manne gefehlt; und ebenso im kleinen Leben des
Hauses und des täglichen Verkehrs von jener Milde, Heiterkeit und
Frische des Gemütes, die so gerne Gefährten echter Größe sind. Alle
diese Eigenschaften hatte er mit seinem damaligen Volke gemein; was ihn
aber über dasselbe erhob, das war der weitschauende Geist, der dem alten
Römertum das Vorbild eines weltumfassenden Staates abgelernt hatte,
und der dies Muster ohne knechtische Nachahmung dem so ganz andern
germanischen Wesen anzupassen wußte. Und zwar ist dieser Geist, der sich
in ihm offenbarte, um so wundervoller, weil niemand nachweisen kann, wie
er sich gebildet, und wer ihn so gelehrt und erzogen hat. Aus dem Dunkel
seiner Zeit geht er, im eigenen Lichte leuchtend, auf.+

[2] +Beim Analysieren von Heldencharakteren.+

[3] the share (+Anteil+, m.) of fortune = of a happy (+günstig+) fate
(+Geschick+, n.).

[4] Supply ‘individuality’; altogether = quite.

[5] made, +geschaffen+; by, +von+. Use the attributive construction as
explained in S. 7, N. 3, _A_.

[6] Say ‘which called him with pride their progenitor’.

[7] Say ‘even the romantic legends’.

[8] Say ‘have crowned his head with glory (+Ruhm+, m.)’. =In elevated
diction ‘head’ is rendered by ‘+Haupt+’=, n.

[9] +bezeugen+.

[10] Say ‘It is indeed (+wohl+) true that none of Charles’s wars can be
compared to (+mit+) the victories of Charles Martel over the Saracens’.

[11] but — conquest = but these were contests for freedom
(+Freiheitskämpfe+), whilst his (to agree with ‘wars’) were contests for
conquest (+Eroberungskämpfe+).

[12] Say ‘and fame (S. 3, N. 2) has more partiality (+Vorliebe+, f.) for
successful aggression (+Angriff+, m.)’, etc.




_Section 128._

CHARACTER OF CHARLEMAGNE.

II.


As _a_ scholar[1], his acquisitions[2] were little superior[3] to those
of his unrespected son; and in[4] several points of view the glory of
Charlemagne might be[5] extenuated by an analytical dissection. But[6]
rejecting a mode of judging equally uncandid and fallacious, we shall
find that he possessed in everything that grandeur of[7] conception which
distinguishes extraordinary minds[8]. Like Alexander, he seemed born[9]
for universal innovation[10]; in a life restlessly active[11], we see him
reforming (S. 78, N. 14, _B_) the coinage[12], and establishing the legal
divisions of money[13]; gathering[14] about him the learned of every
country, founding schools _and_ collecting libraries; interfering[15],
but with the tone of a King, in religious controversies; aiming[16],
though prematurely, at the formation of a naval force; attempting[17],
for[18] the sake of commerce, the magnificent[19] enterprise of uniting
(S. 1, N. 3) the Rhine and[20] Danube; and[21] meditating to mould
the[22] discordant codes of Roman and barbarian laws into one uniform
system.—HALLAM, “THE STUDENT’S MIDDLE AGES.”

[1] Scholar = ‘pupil or schoolboy’ is rendered by +Schüler+; = ‘student’
by +Student+, and = ‘learned man’ by +Gelehrter+. The last sense is
applicable here.

[2] acquisitions = knowledge.

_Passing_ through an ante-chamber, where, in cupboards, stand
his mineralogical collections, we enter (App. § 14) the study, a
low-_roofed_, narrow room (+Gemach+, n.), somewhat dark (S. 128, N. 11),
for it is (S. 2, N. 1) lighted only through two tiny windows, and[1]
furnished with a simplicity quite touching to behold.

In the centre[2] stands a plain oval table of unpolished oak[3]. No
arm-chair is to be seen, no sofa, nothing which (S. 3, N. 7) speaks[4]
of comfort. A plain hard chair has[5] beside it the basket in which he
used[6] to place his handkerchief. Against[7] the wall, on the right, is
a[8] long pear-tree table, with book-shelves, on which stand lexicons
and manuals. Here hangs a pincushion, venerable in[9] dust, with the
visiting-cards, and other trifles which[10] death had made sacred.
Here[11] also a medallion of Napoleon, with this[12] circumscription:
“Scilicet[13] immenso superest ex nomine multum.” On the side-wall again,
a book-case, with some works of poets. On the wall to the left is a long
desk of soft wood, at[14] which he was wont[6] to write. A sheet of
paper with notes of[15] contemporary history is fastened near[16] the
door, and behind[17] this door tables[18] of music and geology.

The same door leads into a bedroom; it is a[1] closet with a window. A
simple bed, an arm-chair by[2] its side, and a tiny washing-table, with a
small white basin _on it_ and a sponge, is[3] all the furniture.

From the other side of the study we enter the library, which should[4]
rather be called a lumber-room of books. Rough[5] deal shelves hold
the books with[6] bits of paper, on which are written “philosophy,”
“history,” “poetry,” etc., to mark the classification. He rose at seven
[o’clock], sometimes[7] earlier, after a sound _and_ prolonged[8] sleep;
for like Thorwaldsen[9] he had a “talent for sleeping,” only surpassed
(S. 7, N. 3, _B_) by[10] his talent for[11] continuous work. Till eleven
he worked without _any_ interruption. A cup of chocolate was then[12]
brought, and[13] he resumed work till one. At two he dined. This[14] meal
was the important meal of the day. His appetite was immense. Even on
_the_ days when[15] he complained of not being hungry, he ate much more
than most men. Puddings, sweets[16], and cakes were always welcome. He
sat[17] a long while over his wine, chatting[18] gaily to some friend or
other—for he never dined alone—or to one of the actors, whom he had often
with[19] him, after dinner, to read over their parts, and to take[20] his
instructions.

‘called’ has the first place of the three verbs, which are used in the
Passive Voice.

[5] Say ‘Upon simple (+schlicht+) deal boards stand the books’.

[6] The passage ‘with — classification’ may be simplified by saying: ‘on
(+an+) which (+denen+) bits of paper with the labels (+Aufschrift+, f.)
... indicate (+bezeichnen+) a certain order’. The abbreviation ‘etc.’
corresponds to the German ‘+u. s. w.+’, which is the short for ‘+und so

He was fond of wine (S. 3, N. 2) and drank daily his two or three
bottles. Lest[1] this statement should convey a false impression, I
hasten to[2] recall to the reader’s recollection the very different
habits of our fathers in respect to drinking. It was no[3] unusual
thing to be called “a three-bottle-man” in those days in England,
when[4] the three bottles were _of_ port or Burgundy; and Goethe, a[5]
Rhinelander, accustomed from boyhood to wine, drank a wine which his
English contemporaries would have called water. The[6] amount he drank
never did more than exhilarate him, and never made him unfit for work or
for society. Over[7] his wine, then, he sat some hours; no _such thing
as_ dessert was seen upon his table in those days; not even the customary
coffee after dinner. His mode[8] of living was extremely simple; and
even when persons[9] of very moderate circumstances burned wax[10],
two[11] poor tallow candles were all that could be seen in his rooms. In
the evening he often went to the theatre, and there[12] his _customary_
glass of punch was brought (S. 4, N. 4, +man+) at six o’clock (App. § 9).
If (S. 27, N. 7) not at the theatre, he received friends at[13] home.
Between eight and nine a frugal supper was laid[14], but[15] he never
took anything except a little salad or preserves. By[16] ten o’clock he
was usually in bed.—G. H. LEWES, “LIFE OF GOETHE.”

of ‘at= (=in= _or_ =during=) =which time’=; as—+Es geschah zu einer
Zeit, ~wo~+ (+zu+ or +in welcher+) +Sie abwesend waren+, it happened at
a time _when_ you were absent. =It is also used relatively, in reference
to place, instead of a relative pronoun preceded by a preposition=;
as—+Kennst du das Land, ~wo~ (in welchem) die Zitronen blühen?+ (Goethe)

THE[1] PROGRESS IN THE ART OF PRINTING.

(Conclusion[2] of a speech delivered at the Caxton Celebration, June 30,
1877, in London.)


I now call[3] attention, in[4] a few words, to the progress of this
art. I hold _up_ a volume in my (S. 43, N. 9) hand, to[5] which I beg
everyone to direct his eye, because I think it[6] may be called the
climax and consummation of this art. This[7] volume is bound, as you see,
and stamped with the arms of the University _of_ Oxford. It is a Bible
bound[8] in a manner that commends itself to the reader—I believe[9]
in every sense an excellent piece of workmanship, containing more than
_one_[10] thousand pages. Well[11], you will say: “That is very[12]
commonplace, why bring it before us?” I do so[13] in order to tell[14]
you that this book sixteen hours ago did not exist—it[15] was not bound,
it was not folded, it was not printed. Since the clock struck twelve
last night at[16] the University Press in Oxford, the people (+man+)
there have printed and sent us this book. They (+man+) have sent several
copies[17] to[18] be distributed here in the midst of your festival. That
shows what can be done, and _that is_ what has been done, and[19] it
shows the state to which this great art is now happily arrived. If[20] I
began with a humiliating confession as to the small share we could claim
in contributing to the early history of printing, we may[21] leave off,
ladies and gentlemen, in a better spirit, because I think that such a
performance as this is[22] one that will be admitted to be a credit in
any portion of the world. Now I will trouble you no longer, but (S. 6,
N. 10) will ask[23] you to[24] drink with me to the memory of this most
distinguished name: “To[25] the memory of[26] William Caxton, the (S.
53, N. 9) first English printer, and a native[27] of _this_ our beloved
country[28].”—THE RIGHT HON. W. E. GLADSTONE.

ROBERT DICK, THE BAKER, GEOLOGIST, AND BOTANIST.


Not long ago, Sir Roderick Murchinson discovered at Thurso, in the far
north of Scotland, a profound[1] geologist, in the person of a baker
there[2], named Robert Dick. When (S. 4, N. 2) Sir Roderick called upon
him at[3] the bakehouse in which (S. 131, N. 4) he baked and earned his
bread, Robert Dick delineated[4] _to him_ by[5] means of flour upon a
board, the geographical features[6] and geological phenomena of his
native country, pointing[7] out its imperfections in[8] the existing
maps, which[9] he had ascertained by travelling over the country in his
leisure hours. On[10] further inquiry, Sir Roderick ascertained[11]
that the humble[12] individual before him was not only a capital baker
and geologist, but also a first-rate[13] botanist. “I found,” said the
Director-General of the Geographical Society, “to my great humiliation,
that this baker[14] knew infinitely more of (S. 40, N. 9) botanical
science, ay, ten times more, than I _did_; and that there were (S. 82,
N. 7) only some twenty or thirty specimens[15] of flowers which he had
not collected. Some he had obtained[16] as presents, some (= others) he
had purchased, but the greater portion had been accumulated[17] by his
industry, in his native county _of_ Caithness; and the specimens[18] were
all arranged[19] in the most beautiful order, with[20] their scientific
names affixed.”—S. SMILES, “SELF-HELP.”

THE GOSPEL OF WORK.

I.


Work, hard[1] work, is a blessing to[2] the soul and the character[3]
of the man who works. Young men[4] may not think so. They[5] may say:
“What[6] more pleasant than to have[7] one’s fortune made for one,
and[8] have nothing more before one than to enjoy life? What[6] more
pleasant than to be idle; or, at least, to do only what one likes, and
no more than one likes?” But they would find themselves mistaken. They
would find that idleness makes a man[9] restless, discontented, greedy,
the[10] slave of his own lusts and passions, and see, too late, that
no man[9] is more to be pitied than the man[11] who has nothing to
do. Yes, thank[12] God, every morning, when you get up, that you have
something to do that day which must be done, whether you like it or
not. Being[13] forced to work, and forced to do your best, will breed
in[14] you temperance and self-control, diligence and strength of will,
cheerfulness and content, and _a_ (S. 132, N. 10) hundred virtues which
the idle[15] man will never know.

[1] +schwer.+

[2] +für.+

[3] character = dignity. Turn ‘of — works’ by ‘of him (+dessen+) who
(after which insert the adv. +da+) works.

[4] men = people, +Leute+. =When ‘people’ signifies ‘persons’ in the
general sense of the word, it is mostly rendered by +Leute+. In the
signification of ‘nation’ it is rendered by +Volk+, n., corresponding to
the Latin ‘populus’ and the French ‘peuple’.= In the first signification,
however, we can often translate it by the indefinite pronoun ‘+man+’,
which also corresponds to the English ‘=they=’, ‘=we=’, ‘=you=’, used in
a general and indefinite sense.

[5] = They say perhaps.

[6] +Was giebt es.+

[7] to have = to see; for one = by (+von+) others.

[8] Say ‘with no other task than to enjoy one’s life’?

[9] ‘=Man=’ is here used in the signification of ‘human being’, when it
is generally rendered by ‘+=der Mensch=+’.

[10] Read S. 102, N. 13.

[11] Use the demonstrative pron. +derjenige+.

[12] When the Imperative of the 2nd pers. is used in a general
application, we use it either in the 2nd pers. sing. or the 2nd pers. pl.
Use the 2nd pers. sing. in this case.


[13] Being — best = The compulsion (+Zwang+, m.) to work (+zur Arbeit+)
and the necessity to do your (= thy) best.

[14] Place ‘in you’ (= thee) after ‘virtues’, immediately before the
infinitive ‘breed’ (= awaken, +erwecken+).

[15] the idle man, +der Müßiggänger+.




_Section 135._

THE GOSPEL OF WORK.

II.


The monks in olden times found it so[1]. When (S. 18, N. 6) they shut[2]
themselves up from the world to worship God in[3] prayers and hymns,
they found that [here follows the subject “they”], without working[4],
without[5] hard work either of head or of hands, they could not[6] even
be good men (S. 134, N. 9). The[7] devil came and[8] tempted them, they
said, as often as they were[9] idle. An idle monk’s soul was lost, they
used (S. 129, N. 6) to say, and they spoke truly. Though they gave[10] up
a large portion of[11] every day, and of every night also, to[12] prayer
and worship, (S. 27, N. 8) yet[13] they found [that] they could not pray
aright without work.

And “working (S. 11, N. 7) is praying,” said one of the holiest of them
that[14] ever lived; and he spoke truth (S. 3, N. 2); if[15] a man
will but do his work for the sake of duty, which is for the sake of
God.—CHARLES KINGSLEY.

[1] Turn ‘it so’ by ‘+das+’, which place at the head of the sentence,
using the inverted construction and inserting the adv. ‘+auch+’ after the
verb.

[2] to shut oneself up, +sich ab´schließen+, sep. comp. str. v. refl.

[3] durch; to worship, +verehren+.

[4] working = work.

[5] +ohne angestrengte Kopf- oder Handarbeit+.

[6] not even, +nicht einmal+.

[7] The words ‘They said’ are best placed at the head of this passage. To
translate the verbs correctly, you must carefully read App. §§ 28 and 30.

[8] and tempted them = in order to tempt them.

[9] +wären.+

[10] ‘to give up’, here = to devote, +widmen+, with dat.

[11] of — also = of the day and of the night.

[12] +dem Gebet und den Andachtsübungen.+

[13] yet, +doch+, to be placed after the subject.

[14] who ever (+je+) has lived. How must the verbs be placed?

[15] Begin a new period here, and say: ‘When a man (S. 134, N. 9) does
his work for the sake of (+um ... willen+, which governs the Gen.) his
duty, (S. 27, N. 8) he does it (to agree with ‘duty’) for God’s sake’.

DO NOT BE ASHAMED OF YOUR ORIGIN[1].

I.


General Bau, a German (S. 101, N. 1) officer in[1] the service
of Russia, who had contributed much to the elevation of the great
Catherine[2], had[3] orders to march to Holstein with a body of troops of
which he had the command. He was a soldier of fortune, and no one knew
either his family or his native place. One day (S. 19, N. 2), as he was
encamped near[4] Husum, he invited the principal[5] officers to dinner.
As they were sitting down to the table, they[6] saw a plain miller
and his wife brought into the tent, whom[7] the general had sent his
aide-de-camp to seek. The poor miller and his wife approached, trembling
(S. 53, N. 12) with[8] apprehension. The general reconciled them to[9]
their situation, and made[10] them sit down beside him to dinner, during
which he asked[11] them a number of questions about their family.

(1702) in die Hände des russischen Generals Scheremetjew, durch den
sie zum Fürsten Menschikow und endlich zum Kaiser Peter dem Großen
kam, der sich in sie verliebte und sich im Jahre 1707 heimlich mit ihr
vermählen ließ. Ihr eigentlicher Taufname war ~Martha~, beim Übertritt
zur griechisch katholischen Kirche erhielt sie jedoch die Namen Katharina
Alexiewna. Im Jahre 1711 gelang es ihr, indem sie sich die Gunst des
Großveziers zu gewinnen wußte, am Pruth das russische Heer durch List
aus gefährlicher Lage zu befreien, worauf sie im Jahre 1712 von Peter
dem Großen öffentlich als seine rechtmäßige Gemahlin anerkannt wurde.
Sie wurde endlich im Jahre 1724 als Kaiserin feierlich gekrönt, als sie
jedoch nach Peters des Großen Tode im Jahre 1725 auf Betrieb des Fürsten
Menschikow als regierende Kaiserin ausgerufen wurde, überließ sie sich
einer zügellosen Lebensweise und starb am 17. Mai 1727. Sie ward Mutter
dreier Töchter, Katharina, Anna (Mutter Peters III.) und Elisabeth, der
nachmaligen Kaiserin.+

DO NOT BE ASHAMED OF YOUR ORIGIN.

II.


The good man told him _that_ he was (App. § 28) the eldest son of a
miller, and that he had two brothers in[1] a mercantile line and a
sister. “But,” said the general, “had you[2] not another brother besides
the two whom you have mentioned?” The miller told him he had another[3]
brother, but[4] he went to the wars very young, and as[5] they had never
heard of him, they supposed he was dead. The[6] general, reading (S.
16, N. 4) in the eyes of the officers that they were surprised at his
entertaining himself so long with questioning the poor man, turned to
them and said: “Gentlemen, you have always been curious to know from
what family I sprung[7]; I now tell[8] you that I am not ashamed of my
origin; that I am the brother of this honest miller; he has given you the
history[9] of my family.” The general, after spending[10] (S. 55, N. 1)
the day with his relations, in[11] the festivity of which his officers
heartily joined, took measures to better their fortune[12].—ANECDOTES.

NOT NEAR ENOUGH YET.


There[1] is a popular report in the Brandenburg district, where
Bismarck’s family has been so many centuries at home, which attributes
to the Bismarcks, as the characteristic saying of the house, the
phrase: “+Noch lange nicht genug+”—(Not near enough yet), _and_ which
expresses[2], we[3] suppose, the popular[4] conception of[5] their
tenacity of purpose—that[6] they were not tired out of any plan they
had formed by a reiterated failure or a pertinacious opposition which
would have disheartened most of their compeers. There[7] is a somewhat
extravagant illustration of this characteristic in Bismarck’s wild,
youthful days, if his biographer may be trusted. When studying[8] law at
Berlin, he had been more than once disappointed[9] by a bootmaker who[10]
did not send home his boots when they were promised. Accordingly[11]
when this next happened, a servant of the young jurist appeared at the
bootmaker’s at six in the morning (App. § 9) with the simple question:
“Are Herr[12] von Bismarck’s boots ready?” When he was told they were
not[13], he departed[14], but _at_ ten minutes past six another servant
appeared, asking[15] the same question, and[16] so at precise intervals
of ten minutes it went on all day, till by[17] the evening the boots were
finished and[18] sent home.—EARLE, “THE PHILOLOGY OF THE ENGLISH TONGUE.”

[1] Say ‘In the province _of_ Brandenburg, where the family Bismarck for
(+seit+) several centuries is at home (‘to be at home,’ here +ansässig

[12] +=Fürst Otto von Bismarck= wurde am 1. April 1815 zu Schönhausen,
dem Stammgute der Familie Bismarck, in der Provinz Brandenburg im
Königreiche Preußen geboren. Er entstammt der alten preußischen adeligen
Familie von Bismarck, welche auch von Bismarck-Schönhausen genannt
wird, um dieselbe von der ihr verwandten Familie von Bismarck-Bohlen
zu unterscheiden. Von Bismarck trat zuerst öffentlich auf dem Landtage
von 1847 als Führer der äußersten Rechten+ (extreme Conservatives)
+und dann als Mitglied der im Jahre 1848 tagenden zweiten preußischen
Kammer+ (the Prussian House of Commons) +als entschiedener Gegner
des Repräsentationssystems+ (Representative Government) +und der
Reichsverfassung hervor. Sein entschiedenes Talent für die diplomatische
Laufbahn bestimmte die Regierung, ihn im Jahre 1851 zum Legationssekretär
bei der preußischen Bundestagsgesandschaft in Frankfurt a/M. zu ernennen.
Drei Monate später wurde er jedoch schon zum Bundestagsgesandten
erhoben, in welcher Eigenschaft er vergeblich Preußens Gleichstellung
mit Östreich beim Bundestage erstrebte. Nachdem er seit dem 1. April
1859 preußischer Gesandter in Petersburg und seit dem Frühjahr 1862
Botschafter in Paris gewesen, trat er am 24. September desselben Jahres
als Minister des Auswärtigen an die Spitze des neu ernannten Kabinetts.
Es würde zu weit führen, hier auf die Einzelheiten seiner großartigen
Erfolge als Ministerpräsident einzugehen, genüge es zu bemerken, daß
sein Hauptstreben darauf gerichtet war, Preußen zur herrschenden Macht
in Deutschland zu machen, Östreich daraus zu verdrängen, und schließlich
durch Auflösung des deutschen Staatenbundes ein einiges Deutschland
unter dem Zepter Preußens zu schaffen. Wie ihm diese Aufgabe gelang,
ist allgemein bekannt. Die schon lange zwischen Preußen und Östreich
bestandene Eifersucht brach endlich im Jahre 1866 durch den Krieg in
lichten Flammen aus. Preußen ging glänzend aus demselben als Sieger
hervor. Durch den Prager Friedensvertrag entsagte Östreich nicht allein
seinen Ansprüchen als Präsidialmacht im deutschen Staatenbunde, sondern
schied gänzlich aus demselben aus und erkannte den unter Preußens
Führung zu stiftenden Norddeutschen Bund an. In Anerkennung seiner
großen Erfolge wurde Bismarck nach beendigtem Kriege in den Grafenstand
erhoben und zugleich zum Kanzler des Norddeutschen Bundes ernannt,
dessen Angelegenheiten er mit so bedeutendem Geschick leitete, daß bei
der im Jahre 1870 von Frankreich an Preußen erfolgten Kriegserklärung
auch die Südstaaten sich dem Norddeutschen Bunde anschlossen und
das ganze Deutschland vereinigt gegen den Feind in den Kampf ziehen
konnte, aus dem es mit Lorbeeren gekrönt siegreich hervorging. Schon
am 18. Januar 1871 ward König Wilhelm I. von Preußen unter Zustimmung
aller deutschen Staaten im Schlosse zu Versailles als deutscher Kaiser
proklamiert. Das große Ziel Bismarcks war erreicht. Die Einheit des
bisher zerstückelten Vaterlandes war wiederhergestellt, ein mächtiges
deutsches Reich unter der Führung Preußens gegründet, und die demselben
drohenden Feinde waren besiegt und geschlagen. Am 20. Mai 1871 wurde von
dem Fürsten und Reichskanzler Bismarck zu Frankfurt a/M. der Friede mit
Frankreich unterzeichnet, durch welchen die früher von dem deutschen
Reiche getrennten Herzogtümer Lothringen und Elsaß demselben wieder
einverleibt wurden und Frankreich sich verpflichtete, an Deutschland eine
Kriegsentschädigung von fünf Milliarden Franken zu zahlen. Die Eröffnung
des deutschen Reichstages in Berlin, am 21. März 1871, gehört vielleicht
zu den größten Triumphen dieses höchst seltsamen bewunderungswürdigen
Mannes.+

A GREAT LOSS.


Mr. Thomas Carlyle had lent the Manuscript of the first volume of his
“French Revolution” to a neighbour to peruse. By[1] some mischance or
other, it[2] had been left lying on the parlour-floor, and[3] become
forgotten. Weeks ran on[4], when at last the historian sent for[5] his
manuscript, the[6] printers being loud for copy. Inquiries[7] were made,
and[8] then it was found that the maid-of-all-work, finding[9] what she
conceived to be a bundle of waste paper on the floor, had[10] used it to
light the kitchen and parlour fires with[11]. Such[12] was the answer
returned[13] to Mr. Carlyle, and his consternation and despair may be
imagined (S. 4, N. 4). There[14] was, however, no help for him but to
set himself resolutely to work to re-write his book; and[15] he turned
to and did it. He had no draft[16], and[17] was compelled to rake up
from his memory facts, ideas, and expressions, which had long since been
dismissed. The composition[18] of the book in the first instance had
been a _work of_ real pleasure; the[19] re-writing of it, a second time,
was one of pain and anguish almost beyond belief. That[20] he persevered
and finished the volume under such circumstances affords[21] an instance
of determination of purpose which has seldom been exceeded.—S. SMILES,
“SELF-HELP.”

Do[2] not think it a mean thing to look up to (+zu+) those who are
superior to yourselves[3]. On the contrary, you will find in practice[4],
that _it is_ only the meanest hearts, the shallowest and the basest (S.
128, N. 11) _who_ feel no admiration, but (S. 6, N. 10) only envy for
those who are better than themselves, who delight in[5] finding fault
with them, blackening (S. 1, N. 3) their character, and showing that
they are not after all so much superior to other[6] people; while[7] _it
is_ the noblest-hearted, the very men who are most worthy to be admired
themselves, who feel[8] most the pleasure, the joy, and the strength of
reverence (S. 3, N. 2); of[9] having some one whom they can look up to
and admire; some one in whose company they can forget[10] themselves,
their own interest, their own pleasure, their own honour and[11] glory,

whatever[12] may betide!”

[9] In order to connect this sentence more closely with the preceding, I
propose to say: ‘the pleasure (+Genuß+, m.) of having (S. 34, N. 10) some
one to (+zu+) whom they _can_ look up, and whom they can admire’. The
auxiliary ‘can’ must be omitted in the first instance.

danger[6], hunger, fatigue, and[7] death itself; the[4] feeling which,
in its highest perfection, made[8] the Apostles forsake all and follow
Christ[9], saying (S. 111, N. 6): “Lord, to[10] whom shall we go?
Thou hast _the_ words of eternal life,” and which made them[11] ready

Use the dat. +Christo+, since +folgen+ governs the dat.

[10] ‘to whom’, here +wohin+ (whither), which appears in the German text

JAMES WATT AND THE STEAM-ENGINE.

I.


James Watt was the great Improver of the steam-engine; but, in truth[1],
as to all that is admirable in its structure, or vast in its utility, he
should rather be described as its Inventor. _It was_ by his inventions
_that_ its action[2] was so regulated as[3] to make it capable of being
applied to the finest and most delicate manufactures, and its power so
increased as to set weight and solidity at defiance. By his admirable
contrivances[4] it has become a thing stupendous alike for its force
and flexibility, for the prodigious power which it can exert, and the
ease, precision, and ductility with which this power can be varied,
distributed, and applied. The trunk of an elephant, that can pick up a
pin or rend[5] an oak, is _as_ nothing to it. It can engrave a seal, and
crush masses of obdurate metal _before it_, draw out without[6] breaking
a thread as fine as gossamer, and lift a ship of war like a bubble in
the air. It can embroider[7] muslin and forge anchors, cut steel into
ribbons[8], and impel[9] loaded vessels against the fury of the winds and
waves.

[1] ‘in truth’ is better not translated here. Say ‘but in regard to (+in
Rücksicht auf+) all that (S. 3, N. 7) refers (+sich beziehen+) to (+auf+)
the excellence of its construction and (+wie+) to (+auf+) the variety
(+Mannigfaltigkeit+, f.) of its application (+Nutzanwendung+, f.), should
he rather (+eigentlich+) be called the Inventor of the same’.

[2] +Wirkung+, f.; in what voice is the verb? Insert the adv. +erst+
after the auxiliary.

[3] as — defiance = as (+um+) to be able to employ it in (+bei+) the
making (+Anfertigung+, f.) of the finest and most delicate (+zart+)
manufactures (+Fabrikate+), and its power so increased as (+um+) to be
able to render resistance (+Widerstand leisten+) to every weight (+Last+,
f.) and every solidity (+Festigkeit+, f.). Translate ‘to be able’ by
+können+, which need be expressed but once, and must be placed at the
very end of the whole period, which, along with the following, is perhaps
the most difficult to translate that has yet been given.

It would be difficult to estimate the value of the benefits which
these inventions have conferred upon this country. There is no branch
of industry that has not been indebted[1] to them; and[2], in all the
most material, they have not only widened most magnificently the field
of its exertions, but[3] multiplied a thousand-fold the amount of its
productions. It was our improved steam-engine, in short[4], that fought
the battles of Europe and sustained and exalted, through[5] the late
tremendous contest, the political greatness of our land. _It is_ the
same great power _which_ now enables us to pay the interest of our debt,
and to maintain[6] the arduous struggle _in which we are still engaged_
(1819) with the skill[7] and capital of countries (S. 16, N. 10) less
oppressed with (+von+) taxation.

But these are poor[8] and narrow views of its importance. It has
increased indefinitely the mass of[9] human comforts and enjoyments,
and[10] rendered cheap and accessible, all over the world, the materials
of wealth and prosperity.

[1] I am greatly indebted to you, +ich habe Ihnen vieles zu verdanken+.

[5] through = in.

[6] +fortsetzen+, which rendering will make the relative clause ‘_in —

It has armed the feeble hand of (S. 3, N. 2) man, _in_ short[1], with a

of mind over the most refractory qualities of matter[4], and laid a sure
foundation for[5] all those future miracles of mechanic power which[6]
are to aid and reward the labours of after generations. It[7] is to the
genius of one man, too, that all this is mainly owing! And certainly
no man ever bestowed such a gift on his kind[8]. The blessing is not
only universal, but[9] unbounded; and the fabled[10] inventors of the
plough and the loom, who were deified by their rude[11] contemporaries,
conferred less important benefits (App. § 5) on mankind than the inventor
of our present steam-engine.

MANUFACTURES OF ENGLAND[1].


The principal branches of[2] the industrial pursuits are the
manufactures[3] of cotton, woollen[4], and worsted goods, iron and
hardware, earthenware[5], hosiery, mining[6], and shipbuilding.
The geographical distribution of the manufacturing[7] population is
dependent partly on natural, partly on accidental circumstances. The
proximity of a coal-field[8] decides the point[9] in many instances[10];
for, even where the raw material is bulky[11], it is generally more
practicable to bring[12] it to the coal (+Kohlen+), than the coal to
it, an[13] instance of which is furnished by the copper-ore of Cornwall
being taken to Swansea to be smelted. The iron manufacture is carried
on[14] generally at[15] the coal-fields, the[16] chief seats being
south Wales, Staffordshire, and Derbyshire. The cotton manufacture
has[17] been located in Lancashire and Cheshire for _the last_ three
centuries; but[18] it has attained its present dimensions very much
through those counties being readily furnished with the raw material
from America, as[19] well as from the abundance of coal outside those
counties; Manchester, Bolton, Oldham, Stockport, and Macclesfield are the
chief seats of the manufacture.—BEVAN, “THE STUDENT’S MANUAL OF MODERN
GEOGRAPHY.”

_has been living_ in Manchester _for_ these last twenty years.

[18] but — America. This clause containing a Gerund (being) preceded by
the preposition ‘through’, must be construed according to S. 1, N. 3,
and S. 87, N. 6 in the following way: ‘but it (+sie+) has received its
present dimension especially thereby (+dadurch+, read S. 87, N. 6), that
these counties can easily be (S. 2, N. 1) supplied with the raw material
from America’. The three verbs must, of course, be placed at the end,
and in such a way that the governing verb (can) stands last, and the
auxiliary of tense in the middle.

[19] as — counties = as also (+wie auch noch+) thereby, that the coal is
[use the pl. in German] to be got (+zu haben sein+) in abundance in the
neighbouring counties.

MR. H. M. STANLEY’S APPEAL[1] FOR SUPPLIES.

I.


                                  Village _of_ N’sanda[2], August 4, 1877.

            To[3] any Gentleman who speaks English at Embomma.

Dear[4] Sir,

I have arrived at[5] this place from Zanzibar with 115 souls, (S. 53,
N. 9) men, women, and children. We are now in[6] a state of imminent
starvation. We can buy[7] nothing from the natives, for they laugh at[8]
our _kinds of_ cloth[9], beads, and wire. There[10] are no provisions in
the country that may be purchased, except on market days, and starving
people cannot afford to wait for these markets. I[11], therefore, have
made bold to despatch three of my young men[12], natives[13] of Zanzibar,
with (+nebst+) a boy named Feruzi, of the English mission at Zanzibar,
with this letter.

I do not know you, but[14] I am told there (S. 104, N. 19) is an
Englishman at (+in+) Embomma, and as you are a Christian and a gentleman,
I beg you not to disregard my request. The boy Robert will be better able
to describe our lone condition than I[15] can tell you in this letter.
We are in _a state of_ the greatest distress; but if your supplies[16]

[2] The village of N’sanda is three days’ journey from Embomma, or Boma,
which is a small town on the Congo or Livingstone River at a distance of
sixty-five English miles from the Atlantic, and, with regard to Stanley’s
position, may be considered the van of civilisation in Africa, being the
first place inhabited by Europeans.—For the full understanding of this
letter, it may be useful to observe that it was written at the critical
period when, at their journey home from the sources of the Nile, and
almost at the end of all their troubles, the heroic travellers of more
than 7000 miles through Equatorial Africa found themselves face to face
with the grimmest of all enemies—starvation. Nearly forty men filled the
sick list with dysentery, ulcers, and scurvy, and the number of victims
of the latter disease was steadily increasing. For a considerable time
the people had had no other food but a few ground-nuts and bananas, and
were scarcely more than skin and bone. In this extremity Mr. Stanley
determined to despatch four of his strongest and swiftest men with this
letter to Embomma, where he was told there was one Englishman, one
Frenchman, and three Portuguese. He then intended to follow these men as
quickly as possible with the rest of his people, and to meet them and
the expected supplies on the road to Boma, thus gaining at least one or
two days, which might turn out to be of the greatest importance to his
starving followers.

MR. H. M. STANLEY’S APPEAL FOR SUPPLIES.

II.


I want 300 cloths[1], each four yards long, of[2] such quality as you
trade with, which is very different from that we have; but[3] better
than all would be ten or fifteen man-loads of rice or grain to fill
the pinched[4] bellies immediately, as[5] even with the cloths it would
require time to purchase food, and starving people[6] cannot wait. The
supplies must arrive within two days, or[7] I may have a fearful time
of it among the dying. Of course I hold myself responsible for any[8]
expense (S. 16, N. 10) you[9] may incur in the business. What is wanted
is immediate relief, and I pray you to[10] use your utmost energies to
forward it at once. If (App. § 21) you have such little luxuries[11]
as tea, coffee, sugar, and biscuits by you, such[12] as one man can
easily carry, I beg you on[13] my own behalf that you will send a small
supply[14] and[15] add to the great debt of gratitude due to you upon the
timely arrival of the supplies for my people. Until[16] that time I beg
you to believe me,

                             Yours sincerely,

                  H. M. STANLEY,
                  Commanding[17] the Anglo-American Expedition for[18] the
                  Exploration of Africa.

P.S. You[19] may not know me by name, I therefore add, I[20] am the
person that discovered[21] Livingstone in 1871. H. M. S.—H. M. STANLEY,

[5] as — food = as (after which place the subject ‘_we_’), even in the
possession of the cloths, we should yet want time to exchange provisions

ANSWER TO[1] THE PRECEDING LETTER.


                         English Factory, Boma, 6th August 1877, 6.30 A.M.

H. M. Stanley, Esq.

Dear Sir,

Your welcome letter came[2] to hand yesterday, _at_ 7 P.M. As[3] soon
as its contents were understood, we arranged to despatch to you such
articles as you requested, as much as our stock on hand would permit,
and other things that we deemed would be suitable in that locality. You
will see _that_ we send fifty pieces _of_ cloth, each twenty-four yards
long, and some sacks containing sundries for yourself; several[4] sacks
_of_ rice, potatoes, a few bundles _of_ fish, a bundle _of_ tobacco, and
one demijohn[5] _of_ rum. The carriers are all paid, so that you need not
trouble yourself about them. That[6] is all we need say about business.
We are exceedingly sorry to hear that you have arrived there in such
(+so+) piteous[7] condition, but we send our warmest congratulations to
you, and hope that you will soon arrive in Boma. (This[8] place is called
Boma by us, though on the map it[9] is Embomma.) Again[10] hoping that
you will soon arrive, and that you are not suffering in health,

                         Believe[11] us to remain,

                           Your sincere friends,

[1] +auf+, with Acc.; A.M. +morgens+; P.M. +abends+.—This letter and the

MR. STANLEY’S ACKNOWLEDGMENT[1] OF THE PRECEDING LETTER AND THE SUPPLIES.

I.


                                             Banza M’Buko, August 6, 1877.

Messrs. A. Da Motta Veiga and J. W. Harrison, Embomma, Congo River.

Gentlemen,

I (S. 115, N. 1) have received your welcome letter, but better _than
all_, and[2] more welcome, are your supplies. I am unable to express
_just_ at present how grateful I feel. At the sight of (+von+) the stores
exposed[3] to our hungry eyes—at the sight of (+von+) the rice, the
fish, _and_ the rum, and[4] for me—wheaten bread, butter, sardines, jam,
peaches, grapes, beer (ye[5] gods! just think of it—three bottles pale
ale[6]!), besides tea and sugar, we (App. § 14) are all so over-joyed
and confused that we cannot restrain[7] ourselves from falling to and[8]
enjoying this sudden bounteous store. I beg you will charge[9] our
apparent want of (+an+) thankfulness to our greediness. If we do not
thank you sufficiently in words, rest assured we[10] feel what volumes
could not describe.

For the next twenty-four hours we shall be too busy eating and drinking
to think of anything else much; but I may say that the people[11] will
cry out joyfully, while[12] their mouths are full of rice and fish:
“Verily, our master has found the sea and his brothers, but we did not
believe him until[13] he showed us the rice and the pambe (rum). We did
not believe there[14] was any end to the great river; but God be praised
for ever, for we shall see white people[15] to-morrow, and our wars[16]
and troubles will be over!”[17]

[1] +Anzeige von dem Empfange+; ‘supplies’, here +Warensendung+, f.

[2] Insert the adverb +noch+ here.

[3] It was exposed to my eyes, +es war vor meinen Augen ausgebreitet+;
‘hungry’, here +gierig+.

[4] +und — des für mich bestimmten Weißbrots+; the article, in the Gen.
case, must be repeated before each of the following nouns.

[5] ye — it = +o sehet, Ihr Götter+.

[6] +Weißbier.+

[7] +bezwingen+; from falling to, +zuzugreifen+.

[8] +und diese uns so schnell und großmütig zugesandten Vorräte zu

[9] I beg you will charge this to his greediness, +ich bitte Sie, dies
seiner Eßbegierde zur Last legen zu wollen+.

[10] we — describe = we feel more than could (App. § 33, and S. 2, N. 1)
be described to you through (+durch+) volumes.

[11] +Leute.+

[12] Say ‘while their mouth is still filled with rice and fish’.

[13] +ehe.+

[17] This letter, on the morning of the 7th of August, was despatched
to Boma, the caravan following slowly, and reaching Boma on the 9th
of August 1877, the 999th day from the date of their departure from
Zanzibar. The expedition then embarked on board a steamer at Boma, and,
on the 11th, descended the river Congo. After steaming northward from
the mouth of the Congo for a few hours, the vessel entered the fine bay
of Kabinda, on the southern shores of which the native town of that
name in the county of Nyoyo is situate. The Expedition, after a stay of
eight days at Kabinda, was kindly taken on board the Portuguese gunboat
‘Tamega’ to San Paulo de Loanda. Here they were treated with the utmost
hospitality by the Portuguese and the officers of the English navy, who
offered the Expedition a passage to Cape Town in H.M.S. ‘Industry’,
Commander R. C. Dyer. The Cape of Good Hope was reached on the 21st of
October. Here a telegram from the Lords of the British Admiralty was
received, authorising the Commodore Francis William Sullivan to prepare
H.M.S. ‘Industry’ for the reception of the Expedition and to convey them
to Zanzibar, the end of their journey. On the 6th of November H.M.S.
‘Industry’ was equipped and ready for her voyage to Zanzibar, which was
reached on the 20th of the same month. By this time the sick had, all but
one, recovered, and had improved so much in appearance that few persons
ignorant of what they had been, could have supposed that these were the
living skeletons that had reeled from sheer weakness through Boma.

MR. STANLEY’S LETTER (continued).

II.


Dear Sirs,

Though[1] strangers, I feel we shall be great friends, and[2] I shall
always remember my feelings of gratefulness, when I first caught sight
of your supplies, and my poor, faithful, and brave people cried out:
“Master, we are saved!—food[3] is coming!” _The_ old and _the_ young—the
men, _the_ women, and _the_ children—lifted their wearied and worn-out[4]
frames[5], and began to chant _lustily_ an[6] extemporaneous song, in[7]
honour of the white people by (+an+) the great salt sea (the (S. 53, N.
9) Atlantic) who had listened to their prayers. I had[8] to rush to my
tent to hide the tears that would issue[9], despite all my attempts to
composure[10].

Gentlemen, that the blessing of God may attend your footsteps
whithersoever[11] you go, is the very earnest[12] prayer of

                             Yours faithfully,

                               H. M. STANLEY,

                         Commanding the Anglo-American Expedition.—

                              H. M. STANLEY, “THROUGH THE DARK CONTINENT.”

[1] +obgleich wir uns noch fremd sind.+

[2] Say ‘and I shall never forget the feelings of gratefulness which I
experienced (+empfinden+, insep. comp. str. v.), when’, etc.

[3] Say ‘there come provisions’!

[4] +abgemagert.+

[5] +Körper+, m., which use in the Sing.

[6] +ein aus dem Stegreife entworfenes Lied+; to chant = to sing.

[7] in — people, +den Weißen ... zu Ehren+; the words +zu Ehren+ must be
placed at the end of the clause.

[8] Use the Imperfect of +müssen+.

[9] to issue = to break forth, +hervor´brechen+.

[10] to composure = to compose myself.

[11] The adverbial clause ‘whithersoever you go’ may be briefly rendered
by the adverb ‘+stets+’.

[12] earnest = sincere; faithfully, +ergeben+ (adject.).




_Section 151._

RETURNED[1] KINDNESS.


When (S. 4, N. 2) the country near[2] Albany was newly settled, a
starving Indian came to the inn at Lichfield and asked for a night’s
shelter and some supper, at[3] the same time confessing that, from[4]
failure in hunting, he had nothing[5] to pay. The hostess drove him away
with reproachful[6] epithets, and as the Indian was about (S. 6, N. 4)
scornfully to retire,—there being (S. 30, N. 4) no other inn for[7] many
a weary mile,—a[8] man, who was sitting by, directed the hostess to
supply[9] his wants, and promised to pay her. As[10] soon as the Indian’s
supper was ended, he thanked his benefactor, and said he would some day
return his kindness. Several years thereafter[11] the settler was taken
a prisoner by a hostile tribe, and carried off to (S. 72, N. 4) Canada.
His life was spared[12], but he was detained in[13] slavery. One[14] day,
however, an Indian came to him, and bade the captive follow him. The
Indian never told where they were going, nor[15] what was his object;
_but_ day after[16] day the captive followed his mysterious guide, till
one afternoon they came suddenly on[17] a beautiful expanse of cultivated
fields, with many houses _rising amongst them_. “Do you know that place?”
asked the Indian. “Ah, yes—it is Lichfield!” and whilst the astonished
exile[18] had not yet recovered from his surprise and (S. 10, N. 9)
amazement, the Indian exclaimed: “And I am the starving Indian, on whom,
at this _very_ place, you took[19] pity. And now that[20] I have repaid
you, I pray you go home!”—DR. DWIGHT.

[1] +vergelten+, insep. comp. str. v.

[2] +unweit+; newly, +eben+; ‘to settle’, here +kolonisieren+.

[3] at — confessing = on which occasion (+wobei+) he confessed.

[4] +wegen erfolgloser Jagd.+

[5] nothing to pay = no money for (+zu+, contracted with the dat. of the
def. art.) paying.

[6] reproachful epithets, +Scheltworte+.

[7] for — mile, +meilenweit in der Runde+.

[8] ‘a man’, here = a guest. The verb ‘directed’ (+heißen+, str. v.) must
be placed before the subject, since the subordinate clause precedes the
principal one.

[9] to supply a person’s wants, +für die Bedürfnisse eines Menschen
sorgen+.

[10] Say ‘As soon as the Indian had eaten (+verzehren+) his supper’.

[11] +später.+

[12] +verschonen.+

[13] in slavery = as _a_ slave; ‘to detain’, here +gefangen halten+.

[14] Say ‘One day, however, came an Indian to the prisoner with the
intimation (+Weisung+, f.) to follow him’. This construction is necessary
to avoid the repetition of the pronoun ‘+ihm+’.

[15] nor — object = or else his intention.

[16] +für.+

[17] +zu einer schönen Fläche urbar gemachter Felder.+

[18] exile = settler.

[19] to take pity on a person, +sich eines Menschen erbarmen+; supply the
adverb +einmal+ (one day) before the verb.

[20] that = since, +da+; to repay a person, +einem seine Schuld
ab´tragen+.




_Section 152._

NEW YEAR’S EVE[1].

I.


It was dreadfully cold; it snowed, and was beginning to grow dark; it was
the last evening of the year,—New-year’s Eve. In this cold, a poor little
girl was wandering about the streets with[2] bare head and bare feet.
She had slippers on when she left home (+Haus+, with the def. art.),
but what was the good of them? They (+Es+) were the large, old slippers
of her mother’s—so large that they fell off the little girl’s feet as
she hurried across the street to[3] escape a carriage, which came[4]
galloping along at a great rate. The one slipper was not to be found, and
a boy ran off with the other.

So the little girl wandered about barefooted, with a quantity[5] of
matches in an old apron, whilst she held a box[6] of them in her (S. 43,
N. 9, _A_) hand. No one had bought _any_ matches of her through[7] the
whole livelong day—no one had given her a single farthing[8]. Hungry, and
pinched[9] with cold, the poor little girl crept[10] along, the large
flakes of snow covering (S. 55, N. 1; use +während+) her yellow hair,
which[11] curled round her face.

In[12] a corner between two houses, one projecting beyond the other, she
sought shelter. Huddling[13] herself up, she drew her poor little feet,
which were red and blue with cold, under her (+sich+) as well _as_ she
could, but she[14] was colder than ever, and[15] dared not go home (S.
63, N. 8), for, as she had sold no matches, her cruel[16] father would
beat her. Besides[17], it was cold at home (S. 63, N. 8), for they lived
just[18] under the roof, and[19] the wind blew in, though straw and
rags had been stuffed in the large cracks. Her little hands were quite
benumbed with cold. Oh[20], how much good one match would do, if she
dared but (+nur+) take it out of the box and draw[21] it across the wall
to warm her fingers in the flames!

[1] +Der Sylvesterabend.+

[2] with — feet, +barfuß und unbedeckten Hauptes+, which place before
‘about (+durch+) the streets’.

[3] to escape a carriage, +einem Wagen aus dem Weg laufen+. For the
translation of the conjunction ‘to’ in this clause compare S. 19, N. 7.

[4] to come galloping along at a great rate, +in vollem Galopp die Straße
entlang kommen+.

[5] a quantity = some.

[6] +Schachtel+, f.; of them = of the same.

[7] through — day, +den ganzen Tag lang+, which is best placed at the
commencement of the period.

[8] +Heller+, m.

[9] to be pinched with cold, +vor Kälte erstarrt sein+.

face’.

[12] In — other, +In einem durch ein hervorspringendes Haus gebildeten

drew her’, etc.

[14] I am cold, +es friert mich+.

[15] Say ‘and yet she (App. § 24, _B_) dared (+wagen+, w. v.) not to go
home’.

[16] ‘cruel’, here = severe.

[17] Say ‘And also (App. § 14) at home it was cold’.

[18] ‘just’, here = immediately.

[19] Say ‘through which the wind blew, although the large cracks
(+Spalte+, f.) were stuffed (+verstopfen+, insep. comp. w. v.) with straw
and rags’.

[20] Say, ‘Oh (+Ach+), how nice (+schön+) must (Imperf. Subj.) a match
be’.

[21] +Ein Zündhölzchen an der Mauer an´reiben+, to draw a match across
the wall.




_Section 153._

NEW-YEAR’S EVE.

II.


She drew one out—“Ritsh!” how it sputtered[1] and burned! It burned with
a warm, bright flame, like a candle, and she bent her hand round it
(S. 4, N. 5, _B_), it was a wonderful light! It appeared to the little
girl as if she were sitting[2] before a large iron stove, in which the
fire burned brightly, and[3] gave out such comfort and such warmth. She
stretched out her feet to warm them, too—but the flame went[4] out, the
stove disappeared, and there she sat, still holding[5] a little bit of
the burnt-out[4] match in her (S. 43, N. 9, _A_) hand.

Another was[6] lighted; it burned, and, where[7] the light fell upon the
wall, that[8] became transparent, so that she could see into the room.
There the table was covered with a cloth of dazzling white, and with fine
china; and a roast goose was smoking most[9] temptingly upon it. But what
was still more delightful, the goose sprang down from the table, and[10],
with a knife and (S. 10, N. 9) fork _sticking_ in its[11] back, waddled
towards the little girl. Then[12] the match went out[4], and she saw
nothing but the thick, cold wall.

She lighted a third one (S. 67, N. 3); and now she was sitting under
the most splendid Christmas-tree. It was larger and more beautifully
decorated[13] than the one (S. 16, N. 10) she had seen at Christmas[14]
through the window at[15] the rich merchant’s. Hundreds of[16] tapers
were burning amongst the green branches, and painted[17] pictures,
such[18] as she had seen in the shop-windows, looked down upon her. She
stretched out[19] both _her_ hands, when the match was burnt[4] out,—

[1] +sprühen+, w. v.

[2] Use the Impf. Subj. according to App. § 33; as if, +als+.

[3] +und ich weiß nicht wie viel Behaglichkeit und Wärme ausstrahlte.+

[4] ‘to go out’, and ‘to burn out’, here +erlöschen+, insep. comp. str. v.

[5] The Present Participle may be used here in German, but where must it
be placed?

[6] In which Voice is the verb here? Introduce the clause by the
grammatical subject ‘+es+’, as explained in S. 104, N. 19.

[7] where = at (+an+) the place (+Stelle+, f.) where.

[8] +diese.+

[9] Use the superlative of +hoch+.

[10] Here follows the verb ‘waddled’.

[11] in its = in the, contracted; towards, +auf ... zu+, which latter
preposition place at the end of the whole period.

[12] Then = Thereupon.

[13] +auf´putzen+, sep. comp. w. v.

[14] at (+an+, contracted with the dat. of the def. art.) Christmas-day.

[15] =The preposition ‘at,’ in the signification of ‘at the house of’ is
generally rendered by the preposition ‘+bei+’, which governs the dative=;
as—

    At Easter we shall all dine _at my mother’s_.

    +Am Ostertage werden wir alle ~bei meiner Mutter~ zu Mittag
    essen.+

[16] +von.+

[17] painted = coloured, +bunt+.

[18] such as, +wie+.

[19] Supply the pronominal adverb ‘+danach+’ before the particle +aus+,
which stands at the end.




_Section 154._

NEW-YEAR’S EVE.

III.


The countless lights rose higher and higher, and she now saw that they
(+es+) were _the_ stars, one of which fell[1], leaving a long line of
light in the sky.

Some[2] one has (S. 29, N. 3) died just now, the girl said; for her old
grandmother, who alone[3] had loved her, but who was now dead, had told
her that[4] when a star fell, a soul took (App. §§ 28 and 30) its flight
up to heaven.

She drew another match across the wall, and in the light it threw[5]
around stood her old grandmother, so bright[6], so mild, and so loving.

“Grandmother,” the little girl cried, “oh, take me with _you_! I know
that you will disappear as soon as the match is burnt out, just like
the warm stove, the delicious roast goose, and the Christmas-tree!” And
hastily she lighted the[7] rest of the matches that remained in the box,
for she wished to keep[8] her grandmother with her as long as possible;
and the matches burnt so brightly, that it was lighter than day. Never
before[9] had she seen her grandmother so beautiful and so tall, and
behold, she[10] now took the little girl in her arms, and[11], in
radiance and joy, flew high, high up with her into the heaven, where she
felt neither (+kein+) cold, nor (+kein+) hunger, nor (+und kein+) fear
any more[12],—for she was with God.

But, in the corner between the two houses, in the cold morning air, lay
the little girl with pale cheeks and smiling lips. She was frozen[13]
to death during the last night of the Old Year. The first light of the
New Year shone upon the dead body of the little girl with the matches,
one[14] box of which was nearly consumed. “She must have tried to warm
herself,” the people said; but no one knew of (+von+) the visions[15]
she had had, or of the splendour that (S. 48, N. 6) surrounded her when
she entered with her grandmother into the joys of a New Year.—After HANS
ANDERSEN, “FAIRY TALES.”

[1] Say ‘fell down and +left (zurück´lassen+) a long line of light
(+Lichtstreifen+, m.) in (+an+) the sky’.

[2] This sentence is best introduced by the grammatical subject ‘+es+’,
see S. 104, N. 19.

[3] Say ‘alone of all’.

[10] It will be best to begin this clause with the adv. ‘now’, and to
turn the personal pronoun ‘she’ into the demonstrative pronoun ‘the
same’, to agree with ‘grandmother’. This will commend itself in order to
avoid ambiguity.

PROVIDENCE[1] VINDICATING THE INNOCENT.


It is (S. 2, N. 1) recorded in history that a beautiful maiden named
Blanche, the serf of[2] an ancient nobleman, was wooed[3] by her master’s
son. Not[4] admiring his character, she scorned[5] his suit. Upon this
his _course of_ love turned[6] to bitter hatred. Just[7] then a precious
string of pearls confided (S. 7, N. 3, _B_) to the maiden’s care was[8]
lost. Her pseudo-lover[9] charged her with the theft, and, in[10]
accordance with the customs of that rude age, she was doomed to die. On
the day of the execution, as the innocent girl knelt to offer[11] her
dying prayer, a[12] flash of lightning struck a statue of Justice, which
adorned the market-place, to the dust. From[13] a destroyed bird’s nest,
built (S. 7, N. 3, _A_, and S. 48, N. 6) in a crevice of the image[14],
dropped the lost[15] pearls, thus[16] declaring the maiden’s innocence.
In a moment the exultant crowd rushed to the scaffold, demanding her
release. There she knelt beside the block, pale and beautiful, and
with a smile of peace upon her lips. They (S. 134, N. 4) spoke[17]—she
answered not. They touched her—she was dead! To preserve her memory they
raised a statue there[18]; and to[19] this day, when[20] men gaze upon
her image, they condemn her oppressor; they praise her for the purity
of her character; they recognise the justice of Him whose[21] lightning
testified her innocence.—W. SMITH.

[1] Say, ‘Providence (S. 3, N. 2) protects innocence.’

[2] of — nobleman = of a nobleman of _an_ old family (+Geschlecht+, n.).

[3] +umwer´ben+, insep. comp. str. v.

[4] = As his character displeased (+mißfallen+, insep. comp. str. v.,

[20] Construe thus: ‘those who look at her image (+Bildnis+, n.) condemn
her oppressor’, and consider App. § 14.

[21] In order to avoid a repetition of the same form of pronoun, turn the
last clause into: ‘who with his lightning testified her innocence’.

NAPOLEON BONAPARTE[1].

I.


Napoleon understood his business[2]. He was a man who in each moment
and[3] emergency knew what[4] to do next. This[5] is an immense comfort
and refreshment to the spirits, not only of (S. 3, N. 2) kings, but[6] of
citizens. Few[7] men have any next; they live from hand to mouth, without
plan, are[8] ever at the end of their line, and, (S. 102, N. 30) after
each action, wait for[9] an impulse from abroad. Napoleon would have
been the first man of the world, if[10] his ends had been purely public.
As[11] he is, he inspires confidence and vigour by the extraordinary
unity of his action.

He is firm[12], sure, and self-denying; he sacrifices everything to
his aim[13]—money, troops, generals, his own safety even, and is not
misled[14], like common adventurers, by[15] the splendour of his own
means. “Incidents ought not to govern policy,” he said, “but[16] policy
incidents.” “To[17] be hurried away by every event, is[18] to have no
political system at all.” His victories were only so many doors[19],
and[20] he never for a moment lost sight of his way onward in the dazzle
and uproar of the present circumstances. He knew what to do, and he flew
to his mark.

He[21] would shorten a straight line to come at his object. Horrible
anecdotes may no doubt be collected (S. 4, N. 4) from his history, of[22]
the price at which he bought his successes; but he must not, therefore,
be set[23] down as cruel, but only as one[24] who knew no impediment to
his will: not[25] bloodthirsty, not cruel; but woe to[26] what person
stood in his way! “Sire, General Clarke cannot combine with General Junot
for the dreadful fire of the Austrian battery.” “Let[27] him carry the
battery.” “Sire, every regiment that approaches the heavy artillery is
sacrificed[28]. Sire[29], what orders?” “Forward! Forward!”

[1] +=Napoleon I.=, ~Kaiser der Franzosen~, geboren den 15. Aug.
1769 zu Ajaccio auf Korsika war der zweite Sohn des Patriziers
Carlo Bonaparte und der Maria Lätitia Ramolini. Nachdem er seit 1779
die Kriegsschulen zu Brienne und Paris besucht hatte, trat er am 1.
Sept. 1785 als Lieutenant der Artillerie in die Armee ein. Im Jahre
1793 wurde er als Artilleriehauptmann seitens der Republik gegen die
Aufständischen in Korsika verwandt, welche ihn ächteten, da er als
Landsmann gegen sie kämpfte. Seit dem 12. Sept. 1793 Oberbefehlshaber
des Belagerungsgeschützes von Toulon, welches sich in den Händen der
Engländer befand, zwang er den Platz am 19. Dez. zur Kapitulation, worauf
er zum Brigadegeneral der Artillerie befördert ward und in der Armee
von Italien im Kriege gegen Östreich diente. Nachdem er sich vielfach
ausgezeichnet hatte, wurde er im Februar 1796 zum Oberbefehlshaber der
Armee von Italien ernannt, reorganisierte dieselbe, eroberte in kurzem
die Lombardei, schlug die Östreicher in mehreren großen Schlachten,
zwang Mantua zur Kapitulation, drang in Istrien, Kärnthen und Steiermark
ein und schloß am 18. April 1797 zu ~Campo Formio~ den für Frankreich
höchst günstigen Frieden mit Östreich ab. Seit dem 9. März 1796 mit
der verwitweten Generalin Josephine Beauharnais vermählt, ward er am
7. Febr. 1800 neben Cambacérès und Lebrun, welche ihm beratend zur
Seite standen, auf zehn Jahre zum ersten Konsul ernannt. Nach mehreren
siegreichen Kriegen mit Östreich, Preußen, Rußland, England u. a., ward
er im Mai 1802 durch Senatsbeschluß auf weitere zehn Jahre und am 2.
Aug. desselben Jahres auf Lebenszeit zum Konsul ernannt. Am 8. Mai 1804
wurde er jedoch schon als Napoleon I. zum erblichen Kaiser der Franzosen
erklärt. Nun folgte eine fast ununterbrochene Reihe von Kriegen mit fast
allen europäischen Mächten, und als er im Jahre 1809 den Höhepunkt seiner
Macht erreicht hatte, ließ er sich, seiner kinderlosen Ehe wegen, von
seiner ebenso klugen wie liebenswürdigen Gemahlin scheiden und vermählte
sich am 2. April 1810 mit Marie Luise, der Tochter Franz I. von Östreich.
Als er jedoch 1812 Rußland den Krieg erklärte, mit der großen Armee in
Rußland einzog, alles hinter sich her verbrannte und zerstörte, dann
aber durch die weltbekannte, stets denkwürdige Einäscherung der großen
Hauptstadt Moskau seitens der heldenmütigen, verzweifelnden Einwohner
gezwungen wurde, den Rückzug anzutreten, auf dem fast die ganze große
Armee von der fürchterlichen Kälte und die durch die Verödung des Landes
verursachte Hungersnot vernichtet wurde—schien das Glück ihn verlassen
zu haben. Von dieser Zeit an folgte ~eine~ Niederlage nach der andern,
von denen die große Völkerschlacht bei Leipzig (18. Okt. 1813), in
welcher der unglückliche Kaiser den vereinigten Heeren der Preußen,
Östreicher und Russen gegenüber stand, die entscheidende war. Napoleon
wurde in derselben gänzlich geschlagen und die fliehende Armee von den
Verbündeten unter Blüchers Führung verfolgt. Nach der Einnahme von
Paris seitens der Alliirten am 31. März 1814 erfolgte dann die durch
den Senat erzwungene Abdankung des Kaisers und dessen Verbannung nach
der Insel Elba, von wo er jedoch schon anfangs März des Jahres 1815
zurückkehrte. Sein bloßes Erscheinen war genügend, das französische Volk
aufs neue für ihn zu begeistern. Überall wurde er mit Jubel begrüßt, sein
Vordringen war unwiderstehlich, die Armee ging freudig zu ihm über, und
schon am 14. März war der König Ludwig+ XVIII. +gezwungen, den jüngst
bestiegenen Thron zu verlassen und sich durch die Flucht ins Ausland zu
retten.—Napoleons zweite Regierung war indessen nur von kurzer Dauer
(100 Tage). Der langersehnte Friede konnte nur durch seinen Untergang
herbeigeführt werden, weshalb die Großmächte Östreich, Rußland, Preußen
und England am 25. März einen Allianzvertrag abschlossen, durch den sie
sich verbanden, Napoleon gemeinschaftlich zu bekämpfen und der Herrschaft
desselben auf immer ein Ende zu machen. Dies gelang ihnen auch bald,
denn am 18. Juni 1815 wurden die noch übrigen, schnell von Napoleon
zusammengerafften Streitkräfte Frankreichs in der großen Schlacht bei
Waterloo unter Wellingtons und Blüchers Führung gänzlich vernichtet.
Napoleon wollte am 21. Juni zu Blois zu gunsten seines noch unmündigen
Sohnes abdanken, seine Abdankung wurde aber nicht angenommen, und als
er sich am 3. Juli in Rochefort nach Amerika einschiffen wollte, fand
er den dortigen Hafen durch englische Kriegsschiffe gesperrt, worauf er
sich unter den Schutz Englands stellte und sich auf das Linienschiff
~Bellerophon~ begab. Auf Beschluß der verbündeten Mächte wurde er nun als
‘~General Bonaparte~’ nach der entlegenen Insel St. Helena transportiert,
wo er am 16. Okt. 1815 anlangte und, in Longwood wohnend, am 5. Mai 1821
in den Armen einiger ihm noch treu verbliebenen Freunde eines natürlichen
Todes starb.+

NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.

II.


In the plenitude of his resources every obstacle seemed to vanish.
“There[1] shall be no Alps,” he said; and he built his perfect roads[2],
climbing[3] by graded galleries their steepest precipices, until Italy
was[4] as open to Paris as any town[5] in France. Having (S. 55, N.
1) decided what was to be done, he did that with[6] might and main.
He[7] put out all his strength. He risked everything, and spared[8]
nothing; neither ammunition, nor money, nor[9] troops, nor generals,
nor[10] himself. If fighting[11] be the best mode of adjusting national
differences (as[12] large majorities of men seem to agree), certainly
Bonaparte was right in making it thorough[13].

He fought[14] sixty battles. He had never enough. Each victory was a
new weapon. “My power would fall[15], were I not to support it by new
achievements. Conquest has[16] made me what I am, and conquest must
maintain me.”

Before[17] he fought a battle, Bonaparte thought[18] little about what he
should do in[18] case of success, but a great deal about what he should
do in case of a reverse of fortune. The same prudence and good sense
marked[19] all his behaviour[20]. His instructions[21] to his secretary
at the palace are worth[22] remembering. He said: “During the night enter
my chamber as seldom as possible. Do not awake me when you have any good
news to communicate[23]; with[24] that there is no hurry; but when you
have bad news, rouse me instantly, for then there is not a moment to be
lost.” His[25] achievement of business was immense, and[26] enlarges the
known power of man. There have been (S. 82, N. 7) many working kings,
from Ulysses to[27] William of Orange[28], but[29] none who accomplished
a tithe of this man’s performance.—EMERSON.

_Section 158._

THE WARLIKE CHARACTER OF THE GERMANS.


The Germans fight as _a_ nation. Whatever[1] their birth[2] or (S. 10,
N. 9) profession, all are trained[3] soldiers. The nation is the army;
the army is the nation. Hence[4] they cannot be moved save at the bidding
of some grand principle, and the stirring[5] of some soul-penetrating[6]
_and_ elevating sentiment; and yet they are as sensible[7] as any nation
that they abandon comfort[8], domestic ease, monetary independence,
everything[9] which (S. 3, N. 7) men (= man) love and live for, in[10]
order to identify the nation and the army. But they are willing to pay
the price. They count[11] hardihood of body and trained[12] courage of
heart the noblest riches of a nation. They reckon[11] _that_ national
independence and national greatness _are a_ thousand times more precious
than gold and silver, and[13] that to die on the field of battle is
better and happier than to rot[14] and crumble away in sybaritic ease.
They[15] hold, too, that[16] the cause of liberty, and the free noble
spirit engendered by the brotherhood of a nationality which affirms its
oneness by noble acts[17], is blessed by God, and that He will give[18]
victory to the armies who go forth to battle in (S. 3, N. 2) trust in[19]
His name. No wonder[20] they fight and triumph[21].—ADMIRAL GARBETT.

THE[1] WAY TO MASTER THE TEMPER.


A London (S. 157, N. 4) merchant, having[2] a dispute with a Quaker
concerning a business account, determined[3] to institute a law-suit
against him. Desirous of amicably settling[4] the matter, the Quaker
called at the house of the merchant, when[5] the latter became so enraged
that he vehemently[6] declared to his servant _that_ he would (App. §§ 28
and 30) not see his opponent. “Well, friend,” said the Quaker quietly,
“may[7] God put thee in a better mind.” The merchant was[8] subdued by
the kindness of the reply, and, after careful consideration, became
convinced that[9] he was wrong. He sent[10] for the Quaker, and[11]
after making a humble apology, he asked: “How were you able to bear my
abuse[11] with so much patience?” “Friend,” replied the Quaker, “I was
naturally[12] as hot[13] and violent as thou _art_, but I knew that[14]
to indulge my temper was sinful, and also very foolish. I observed that
men in a passion always spoke very loud, and I thought that[15], if
I could control my voice, I should keep down my passion. I therefore
made[16] it a rule never to let it rise above a certain key; and by _a_
careful observance of this rule I have, with the blessing of God[17],
entirely mastered my[18] natural temper.”—ALCOTT.

_Section 160._

OPINIONS[1] AS TO ENGLISH EDUCATION.

I.


This[2] energy of individual life and example acting throughout society
constitute[3] the best practical education of Englishmen. Schools,
academies, and colleges[4] give but the[5] merest beginning of culture
in comparison with it (S. 4, N. 5). Far higher[6] and more practical
is[7] the life-education daily given in our homes, in[8] the streets,
behind (S. 3, N. 2) counters[9], in workshops, at the loom and behind
the plough, in counting-houses and manufactories, and[10] in all the
busy haunts of men. This is the education that[11] fits Englishmen
for doing the work and acting the part of free men. This[12] is that
final instruction as members of society, which Schiller designated “the
education of the human race,” consisting[13] in action, conduct[14],
self-culture, self-control—all[15] that tends to discipline a man truly,
and fit him for the proper performance of the duties of life—a _kind
of_ education not to be learnt (S. 7, N. 3 _B_) from (+aus+) books.
Lord Bacon observes that[16] “Studies teach not their own use, but that
there is (S. 82, N. 7) a wisdom without them and above them, won (S.
7, N. 3 _B_, and S. 2, N. 1) by (+durch+) observation, a remark that
holds[17] true of[18] actual life, as well as of[19] the cultivation of
the intellect itself. For _all_ observation serves[20] to illustrate and
enforce the lesson, that _a_ man perfects himself by work much more than
by reading[21],—_that_[22] it is life[23] rather than literature[21],
action[24] rather than study, _and_ character[25] rather than
biography[26], which[27] tend perpetually to renovate mankind.”

[1] +Ansichten über.+

[2] This — society. A good German rendering of the thought underlying
this line is so difficult, that the author thinks it best to give at once
his own translation, which he hopes will find acceptance: +Diese im mehr

[22] This conj. ‘that’ is best omitted, since a repetition of subordinate
clauses must, as far as possible, be avoided.

[23] = practical life; ‘rather than’ seems here to be = ‘and not’.

[24] +Thätigkeit+, activity.

[25] The English word ‘character’ is so varied in its application that
it requires always the greatest discrimination to decide upon its
translation, and in this case more than ever. After careful consideration
it is thought to be equivalent here to: ‘the personal dignity of a man’.

OPINIONS AS TO ENGLISH EDUCATION.

II.


Goethe (S. 5, N. 2), in _one of his_ conversations with Eckermann
at Weimar, once[1] observed: “It is very[2] strange, and I know not
whether[3] it lies in race, in climate, in[4] soil, or in their
healthy[5] education, but[6] certainly Englishmen seem to have a great
advantage over most other men. We see here in Weimar only a[7] minimum
of them, and[8] those, probably, by no means the best _specimens_, and
yet what splendid fellows they are! And although they come here as
seventeen-year-old[9] youths, yet they by no means feel strange in this
strange land; on the contrary, their entrance[10] and bearing[11] in
society is so confident[12] and quiet, that one would[13] think they were
everywhere the masters, and the whole world belonged to them[14].”

“I should not like to affirm, for all that[15],” replied Eckermann[16],
“that the English gentlemen in Weimar are cleverer, better educated, and
better hearted than our young men.”

“That is not the point[17],” said Goethe; “their superiority does not lie
in such things; neither[18] does it lie in their birth and fortune[19];
it lies precisely[20] in their having[21] the courage to be what nature
made them. There[22] is no halfness about[23] them. They are complete[24]
men. Sometimes complete fools also, that I heartily[25] admit, but even
that is something, and has its weight.”

Thus (App. § 14), in[26] Goethe’s eyes, the Englishmen fulfilled, to a
great extent, the injunction[27] given by Lessing[28] to those who would
be men:

“Think wrongly, if you please, but think for yourselves!”—S. SMILES,
“SELF-HELP.”

[1] = one day.

[2] ‘Very’ is often rendered by the superlative of the adv. +hoch+.

[3] ‘whether it lies’ may be elegantly translated by omitting the
conjunction ‘whether’ and using the inversion.

[5] +heilsam.+

[6] Say ‘but it seems to be certain that Englishmen possess a great
superiority over most other men’.

(+dennoch aber+) they are (+sind es+) splendid fellows!

equivalent to ‘that one would be inclined to think’. The following verbs
must be constructed according to App. §§ 29 and 30.

_Section 162._

A ROYAL JUDGMENT.


A man and his wife named Lambrun had been many years in the service of
the unfortunate Queen Mary Stuart, and were sincerely attached to her.
The tragical death of that princess had such an effect on the husband
that he did not long survive her, and the[1] widow, Margaret Lambrun,
resolved to revenge, upon[2] Queen Elizabeth, the[3] death of two persons
so dear to her. She (S. 5, N. 2) therefore disguised[4] herself in man’s
clothes, bought (S. 58, N. 8) a brace[5] _of_ pistols, and went[6] to (S.
72, N. 4) London. Soon after, when the queen[7] appeared in[8] public,
Margaret endeavoured to[9] make her way through the crowd in order to
shoot her[10]; but one of the pistols fell[11], and she was immediately
apprehended.

The[12] queen, being informed of the circumstance[13], ordered[14] the
man to be brought before her, and said to him: “Well, Sir, who are
you[15]? and why do you seek[16] to kill me?”—“Madam,” replied Margaret,
“I am a woman; I was a long time in the service of Queen Mary Stuart,
whom you put[17] to death unjustly; her execution caused[18] the death of
my dear husband, who was sincerely attached to her; and my affection for
both _of them has_ excited[19] me to revenge.”—“And how do you think I
ought to deal[20] with you?” asked Elizabeth.—“Do you speak as _a_ queen
or as _a_ judge?” returned Margaret.—“As _a_ queen.”—“Then you ought to
pardon[21] me,” was the answer.—“And what security[22] can you give me
that you will not attempt[16] my life again?”—“Madam, a[23] pardon
granted upon conditions ceases to be a favour[24].”—“Well then,” said the
queen, “I pardon you, and trust to your gratitude for[25] my safety.”—P.
SADLER.

TACITUS.


I am glad to find[1], by your (= thy) letter just received, that you are
reading Tacitus[2] with _some_ relish. His style is rather quaint[3] and
enigmatical, which (S. 3, N. 7) makes[4] it difficult to the student;
but then[5] his pages[6] are filled with such admirable apothegms and
maxims of political wisdom, as[7] infer the deepest knowledge of human
nature; and it is particularly necessary that any one intending to become
a public speaker should[8] be master of his works, as[9] there is neither
an ancient nor a modern author who affords such a selection of admirable
quotations. You should exercise yourself frequently in[10] trying to make
translations of the[11] passages which most strike[12] you, trying[13]
to invest[14] the sense of (S. 25, N. 5) Tacitus in as good English as
you can. This will answer[15] the double purpose of making yourself
familiar with the Latin author, and giving you the command of[16] your
own language, which no person will ever have[17] who[18] does not study
composition in early life.—SIR WALTER SCOTT, “LETTERS TO HIS SON.”

[1] here +ersehen+; by, +aus+.

[2] Use the def. art. accord. to S. 25, N. 5.

[3] = unusual and unclear (+dunkel+).

[4] to make difficult, +erschweren+; student = pupil.

[5] = on the other hand, +andererseits+.

_Section 164._

HUMILITY.


I believe the first[1] test of a truly great man is his humility. I do
not mean by[2] humility, doubt of[3] his own power, or hesitation[4] in
speaking[5] his opinions, but a right understanding of the relation
between[6] what he can do and say, and[7] the rest of the world’s sayings
and doings. All great men not only know[8] their business[9], but usually
know[10] that[11] they know it; they are not only right in their main
opinions[12], but they usually know that they are right in them (S. 4, N.
5, _B_); only they do not think much of themselves on[13] that account.
Arnolfo[14] knows he can build a good[15] dome at Florence; Albert[16]
Dürer writes calmly[17] to one who had found fault with his work: “It
cannot be better done;” Sir Isaac Newton knows that he has worked[18] out
a problem or two that would have puzzled anybody[19] else:—only they do
not expect their[20] fellow-men therefore to fall down and worship them;
they[21] have a curious under-sense of powerlessness, feeling (S. 30, N.
4) that the greatness is[22] not in them, but through them; that they
could (App. § 33) not do or be anything else than[23] what God made them.
They see something divine and God-made[24] in every other man, and are
endlessly, nay[25] incredibly merciful[26].—ANONYMOUS.

RUSSIAN POLITICAL PRISONERS IN BANISHMENT.

I.


In the cheerless regions of[1] Arkangel, of which the aborigines say:
“God made Russia, but the devil made Arkangel,” there are (S. 82, N. 7)
more than two hundred of those banished ones—men and women, all young,
all (= and) poor, most[2] of them sent without trial, few[3] amongst
them knowing even of what they are accused. Victor Ivanovitch[4] dines
with his friend B., for instance, and[5] after a stroll along[6] the
boulevards they separate. B. is arrested that[7] very evening, and when
Victor, astonished and horror-stricken[8], hastens[9] to inquire the
cause, he finds everybody[10], even B.’s _own_ father, as[11] much in the
dark as he _is himself_; all questions and petitions on[12] the subject
receive[13] vague administrative answers; all friends and relatives
are systematically discouraged and silenced; eagerly they wait for[14]
the numerous political trials that[15] come on without intermission,
hoping[16] to see the missing one’s (S. 67, N. 3) name on[17] the list of
criminals, or to see[18] his face once more, let[19] it be even in[20]
the prisoner’s dock; but as[21] they wait and[22] watch, the prisoner[23]
is, without any trial, en route for Arkangel.

Arrived[24] there, the routine (App. § 15) is the same for all;
whatever[25] the crime alleged, the age or sex, the[26] prisoner is taken
to the police-ward,—a[27] dreary log-building, containing two sections,
one for men, the other for women. The solitary table and chair in the
room, the four walls, and even the ceiling, are covered[28] with the
names of[29] youthful predecessors, whose pencilled[30] jests and clever
caricatures bear[31] witness to the strength of confidence in themselves
with which they began[32] their life in exile.

In this dreary abode[1] a week or ten days is spent, when[2] the governor
of Arkangel, after due reflection, marks out[3] for this dangerous
personage some final place of exile (S. 76, N. 22, _B_), some[4]
miserable little district town[5], such as Holmogor, Shenkoursk, Pinega,
or Mexen. The[6] prisoner is then told his “documents” are ready, and
a gendarme enters, saying[7] it is time to start[8]. The exile jumps
into the jolting post-waggon, two gendarmes jump _in_ after him, the
bell above[9] the horse’s neck begins to ring—and rings _on_ for[10]
days and weeks—through wood[11], _and_ swamp, and plain, along[12]
roads inconceivably drear and lonely, until the[13] weary convoy at
length arrives at his destination. The little town is desolate and
black[14], and consists of log-huts, two unpaved streets, and a wooden
church painted green, and the[15] live-stock consists of ten or twelve
raw-boned[16] horses, a small herd of sickly[17] cows, and thirty or
forty reindeer. The population rarely (S. 102, N. 30) exceeds _one_
(S. 132, N. 10) thousand[18], and consists of the Ispravnik[19], ten
subaltern[20] officers, the Arbiter[21] of the Peace, the[22] Crown
Forester, a priest, a few shopkeepers, thirty or forty exiles, a[23]
chain-gang of Russian felons, and a crowd[24] of Finnish beggars. On
his arrival, the prisoner is driven straight to (S. 72, N. 4) the
police-ward, where he is inspected[25] by (S. 106, N. 23) the Ispravnik,
a (S. 53, N. 9) police officer, who is absolute lord and master of the
district. This representative of the Government requires[26] of him
to answer the following questions: His[27] name? How old? Married or
single? Where from? The address of[28] parents, relations, or friends?
Answers[29] to all of which are entered in the books.

[1] +Aufenthaltsort+, m.; a — spent = spends (+verbringen+) the prisoner
eight or ten days.

[2] = whereupon.

[3] to mark out, +bezeichnen+; for this = to this (Dat.); personage =
character; some final = his definite (+definitiv+). The Dat. should be
placed immediately after ‘+Arkangel+’.

[4] = a.

[5] +Kreisstadt+, f.; such as = as for example.

[6] Construe this passage accord. to the following model: I am told the
documents are destroyed, +Es+ (S. 104, N. 19) +wird mir mitgeteilt, daß
die Papiere vernichtet sind+.

[7] +mit dem Bemerken, daß+, etc.

[8] ‘to start,’ of a conveyance, a train, etc., is generally rendered by
+ab´fahren+.

[9] = at, +an+.

[10] for years, +jahrelang+.

[11] Use the pl. for this and the two following nouns.

[13] the — convoy = the exhausted travellers.

[14] black = gloomy.

[15] +Viehstand+, m.

[16] +abgemagert.+

[17] +siech.+

[18] Supply ‘souls’.

[19] This term may be used in its unaltered form, but is perhaps better
rendered by ‘+Polizeipräsident+’, m.

[20] +Unterbeamte+, m.

[21] +Friedensrichter.+

[22] Nom. +der kaiserliche Forstbeamte+.

[23] +einem Haufen russischer Verbrecher in Ketten.+

[24] = number.

[25] = examined; who — district = with absolute (+unumschränkt+) power
(+Vollmacht+, f.) over the whole district.

the Gen., but without art.

[27] = your.

[28] Say ‘of your parents’.

entered (+ein´tragen+) in the books’.

III.


A[1] solemn promise is then exacted of him that he will not give lessons
of[2] any kind, or[3] try to teach[4] anyone; that every letter (S. 48,
N. 6) he writes will go through the Ispravnik’s hands, and[5] that he
will follow no occupation except shoemaking, carpentering, or field
labour. He is then[6] told he (App. § 28) is free, but[7] at the same
time is solemnly warned that[8] should he attempt to pass the limits of
the town, he would be shot down like a dog rather than be allowed to
escape; and[9], should he be taken alive, would be sent off to Eastern
Siberia without further formality than that of the Ispravnik’s personal
order.

The poor fellow takes up his little bundle, and[10], fully realising that
he has now bidden[11] farewell to the culture and material[12] comfort of
his past[13] life, he walks[14] out into the cheerless street. A group
of exiles, all pale and emaciated, are (S. 107, N. 13) there[15] to (S.
19, N. 7) greet him, take[16] him to _some of_ their miserable lodgings,
and feverishly demand[17] news from home. The new comer gazes on them as
_one_ in a dream; some are melancholy, and almost mad, others nervously
irritable, and the remainder have evidently tried to find solace in[18]
drink. They live (S. 116, N. 17) in[19] communities of twos and threes,
have food, a scanty provision of clothes, money[20], and books in
common, and consider[21] it their sacred duty to help each other in
every emergency, without[22] distinction of (S. 3, N. 2, and S. 10, N.
9) sex, rank, or age. The noble by[23] birth get sixteen shillings[24] a
month from Government for their maintenance, and[25] commoners only ten,
although many of them are married, and[26] sent into exile with young
families[27].

[1] Say ‘Hereupon one demands (+verlangen+) of him the solemn promise’.

[2] not of any kind, +keinerlei+, adj. (indeclinable).

[3] or try = and not try. The auxiliary verb of mood ‘_+will+_’ need be
expressed but once, and stands, of course?

[4] +unterrichten+, insep. comp. w. v. tr.

[5] Say ‘and that he besides (+außer+) shoemaking (+Schuhmacherei+, f.,
with def. art.), carpentering and field-labour, will carry on (+treiben+)
no (+keinerlei+) occupation’.

[6] ‘then’, here +Endlich+, with which begin the clause, and construe
accord. to S. 4, N. 4 (+man+).

[7] but — warned, +aber zugleich kündigt man ihm an+.

[8] that — escape. This passage requires an altogether different
construction in German; say ‘they (+man+) would upon (+bei+) an attempt,
to go beyond (+überschreiten+, insep. comp. str. v. tr.) the limits
of the town, not allow him to escape, but rather (+vielmehr+) shoot
him down like a dog’ (liter.—but him rather like a dog shoot down,
+nie´derschießen+)’.

[9] Say ‘should he however be caught (+ein´fangen+) alive, (+so+) they
(+man+) would send him without further formality (+Formalität+, f.), upon
the simple order of the Ispravnik to the East of Siberia’.

[10] and — realising = and well knowing (pres. p.).

[12] +materielle Bequemlichkeiten+ (Nom. pl.), which use with the def.
art. in the Dat. pl.

[13] = former.

[15] = outside.

[16] Supply the pron. ‘these’ before the verb take (+führen+, i.e. lead);
to = into.

[17] to demand news from home, +einen nach Nachrichten aus der Heimat
fragen+.

[18] in drink, +im Trunke+.

[19] in — threes, +je zwei oder drei zusammen+.

[20] Supply ‘as also’ before ‘money’; in common, +gemeinschaftlich+.

[21] My parents consider it their duty to help their neighbours in every
emergency, +meine Eltern halten es für ihre Pflicht, ihren Nachbarn in
jeder Not und Gefahr beizustehen+.

[22] Insert ‘+und zwar+’ before ‘without’, which will improve the

RUSSIAN POLITICAL PRISONERS IN BANISHMENT.

IV.


Daily a gendarme visits[1] their lodgings, inspects[2] the premises when
and how he pleases[3], and now[4] and then makes some mysterious entry
in his note book. Should[5] any of their number carry a warm dinner, a
pair of newly-mended boots, or a change of linen to some passing exile
lodged for the moment in the police-ward, it is just as likely as not
marked against him as a crime. It is a crime to[6] come and see a friend
off, or accompany[7] him a little on the way. In[8] fact, should the
Ispravnik feel[9] out of sorts—the effect of cards[10] and drink—he[11]
vents his bad temper on the exiles; and as[12] cards and drink are the
only amusements in these dreary regions, crimes[13] are often marked down
against the exiles in astonishing numbers, and[14] a report of them sent
to the Governor of the province.

Winter lasts eight months, a[15] period during which the surrounding[16]
country presents the appearance of a noiseless[17], lifeless, frozen
marsh. No roads, no communication with the outer world, no means
of[18] escape. In course of time almost every exile is attacked[19] by
nervous convulsions, soon[20] followed by prolonged apathy and complete
prostration. Some of them contrive[21] to forge passports, and by a
miracle, as[22] it were, make their escape; but the great majority of
these victims of the Third Section[23] either go mad, commit suicide, or
die of[24] delirium tremens.—JAMES ALLEN.

[1] visits = comes into.

_Section 169._

Tahiti[1].

I.


At[2] daylight Tahiti, an island which must for ever remain[3] classical
to the voyager in the South Sea, was in view. At a distance the
appearance[4] was not attractive. The[5] luxuriant vegetation of the
lower[6] part could not yet be seen; and as the clouds rolled[7] past,
only the wildest[8] and most precipitous peaks showed themselves[9]
towards[10] the centre of the island. As soon as we anchored in[11]
Matavai Bay we[12] were surrounded by canoes. After dinner we landed and
enjoyed the delights[13] always[14] produced by the first impressions
of a fine country. A crowd _of_ men, women, and children was collected
on the shore, _ready_ to (S. 19, N. 7) receive us with laughing, merry
faces. They[15] marshalled us towards the house of (S. 10, N. 2) Mr.
Wilson, the[16] missionary of the district, who met[17] us on the road,
and gave[18] us a very fine reception. After sitting[19] a short time in
his house, we separated from our host to[20] walk about, and[21] returned
in the evening.

The[22] land capable of cultivation is[23] scarcely in any part more than
a fringe of low alluvial soil, accumulated round[24] the base of the
mountains, and[25] protected from the waves of the sea by a coral reef,
which encircles the entire line of coast. Within the reef there[26] is
an expanse of smooth water, like that of a lake, where[27] the canoes
of the natives can ply with safety, and where[28] ships anchor. The low
land, which[29] comes down to the beach of coral sand, is covered[30] by
the most beautiful productions of[31] the intertropical regions. In the
midst of bananas[32], orange, cocoa-nut, and bread-fruit trees, spots[33]
are cleared where yams[34], potatoes, the sugar-cane, and pine-apples are
cultivated[35].

[1] +~Tahiti~ ist die größte der Gesellschaftsinseln+ (Society Islands)
+im stillen Meere oder der Südsee+ (Pacific Ocean) +und besitzt ungefähr

übersetzt, und auch in den Kirchen und Schulen wird in der Landessprache

_Section 170._

TAHITI.

II.


Even the brush-wood is[1] an imported fruit-tree, _namely_ the guava[2],
which grows in abundance here. In Brazil I have often admired the
varied[3] beauty of the bananas (S. 71, N. 2), palms, and orange-trees
contrasted[4] together; and here we also have the bread-fruit[5],
conspicuous[6] from its large, glossy, _and_ deeply digitated leaves. It
is admirable[7] to behold groves of a tree, sending[8] forth its branches
with the vigour of an English oak, loaded[9] with large _and_ most
nutritious fruit[10].

However[11] seldom the usefulness of an object can account for the
pleasure of beholding it, in the case of these beautiful woods, the
knowledge of their high productiveness, no doubt, enters largely into
the feeling of admiration. The[12] little winding paths, cool from the
surrounding shade, led to the scattered[13] houses, the owners of which
everywhere gave[14] us a cheerful[15] _and_ most hospitable reception.

I[16] was pleased with nothing so much as with the inhabitants. There[17]
is a mildness in the expression of their countenances which at once
banishes the idea of[18] a savage, and an intelligence[19] which shows
that they are[20] advancing in civilisation. The common people, when
working, keep[21] the upper part of their bodies quite naked; and[22] it
is then that the Tahitians are seen to advantage. They are very tall,
broad-shouldered, athletic, and well proportioned. It (S. 4, N. 4, +man+)
has been remarked that[23] it requires little habit to make a dark skin
more pleasing and natural to the eye of a European than his own colour.

[1] = consists of.

[7] = splendid; groves of a tree = a forest of trees.

[8] = spreading out their, etc.

[9] = and are at the same time (+dabei+) loaded.

[10] Use this noun in the pl.

[11] Arrange this period thus: ‘Although the usefulness of an object
perhaps only seldom explains to us the pleasure, which we experience at
the sight of the same, yet (+so ... doch+) our admiration at the sight of
these splendid groves (+Wälder+) is no doubt considerably influenced by
(= through) our knowledge of (+von+) their great fertility.

inhabitants’.

[17] Say ‘The expression of their faces (+Ihr Gesichtsausdruck+) bears a

commence the period.

[22] = and just then one sees the Tahitians (+die Tahitianer+) to
advantage (= in the best light).

[23] = that after _a_ short time a dark skin appears to the eye of a
European more pleasing and more natural than his own.

TAHITI.

III.


A white man bathing (S. 16, N. 4) by the side of a Tahitian was[1] like
a plant bleached (S. 7, N. 3, attrib.) by the gardener’s art compared[2]
with a fine dark-green _one_ growing vigorously[3] in the field. Most
of the men are tatooed, and the ornaments follow the curvature[4] of
the body so[5] gracefully, that they[6] have a very elegant effect. The
most common pattern, varying[7] in its details, is _somewhat_ like[16]
the crown of a palm-tree. It springs[8] from the central line of the
back, and gracefully curls[9] round both sides. The simile may[10] be a
fanciful one, but I[11] thought the body of a man thus ornamented[12] was
(App. §§ 29 and 30) like[13] the trunk of a noble tree embraced[14] by a
delicate creeper.

Many of the elder people[15] had their feet covered with small figures,
so[16] placed as to resemble a sock. This fashion, however, is partly
gone[17] by, and has been succeeded[18] by others. Here[19], although
fashion is far from immutable, every one must abide[20] by that
prevailing at his youth. An old man has thus[21] his age for ever stamped
on his body, and _he_ cannot assume[22] the airs of a young dandy. The
women are tatooed in the same manner as the men, and[23] very commonly on
their fingers.

In[24] returning to the boat, we witnessed[25] a very pretty scene.
Numbers[26] of children were playing on the beach, and had lighted
bonfires, which illuminated the placid sea and[27] surrounding trees;
others, in[28] circles, were singing Tahitian verses. We seated ourselves
on the sand, and[29] joined their party. The songs were impromptu[30],
and[31] I believe related to our arrival. One little girl sang a
line[32], which[33] the rest took up in parts, forming[34] a very pretty
chorus. The whole scene made[35] us unequivocally aware that[36] we were
seated on the shore of an island in the far-famed[37] South Sea.—CHARLES

I left the village _of_ Henderson, in Kentucky, situated[3] on the

for me—a pair _of_ Norway rats had taken possession of the whole, and
reared a young family among the gnawed[14] bits of paper, which, but[15]

the air! The burning heat which[17] instantly rushed through my brain
was too great without[18] affecting my whole nervous system. I slept for

THE BATTLE OF[1] KASSASSIN.

I.


                                        Mahsamah, Monday, August 28, 1882.

At[2] seven this morning, guns were heard in the direction of Kassassin,
which is[3] four miles to our front. The troops were called[4] under
arms, the Cavalry, consisting of the Household Cavalry[5] and 7th Dragoon
Guards, saddled _up_, and the Infantry fell[6] in in readiness to[7]
march to the assistance of the force there under General Graham. That
officer, however, sent a[8] message saying that the firing was in the
enemy’s camp, and[9] was inexplicable, except upon the supposition that
the Egyptians were fighting[10] among themselves.

At[11] eleven o’clock, however, the flags of the signallers at Kassassin
were in motion, and (S. 104, N. 19) the news came that the enemy were
approaching[12]. The Cavalry again turned out[13] and rode _off_ to
Kassassin. As the enemy approached, General Graham opened fire with his
two guns, and[14] the Egyptian artillery replied. The 19th Hussars[15]
came on[16] to the place from Mahuta, where General Willis has his
headquarters.

The enemy made no attack, but halted at[17] a considerable distance from
the camp, and kept[18] up a continued shell-fire, but at a distance
altogether[19] out of range. Their conduct[20] was, indeed, altogether
inexplicable. The Cavalry remained out all day, and the Infantry _here_
were kept in readiness to march at[21] a moment’s notice, but as the
enemy made[22] no movement in advance, they were not called _forward_ to
the front.

The heat was terrific[23] all day, the[24] sun beating down with almost
insupportable force upon the wide sand waste. It[25] had been hard
work for horses and men. No shade was obtainable[26], and the hot wind
raised[27] great dust storms, which penetrated[28] everywhere and made
breathing difficult. The brigade of Guards (S. 36, N. 7, _A_) fell in
under arms[29] ready[30] to march, but the Cavalry returned and reported
that the enemy had fallen back[31], after[32] keeping the troops the
whole day out in the full force of the sun.

[1] +bei+. The very graphic account of the Battle of Kassassin given
in Sections 173-177 was written by the correspondent of the London
‘Standard’, who was with the cavalry at Mahsamah. Kassassin (also called
Kassassin Lock) is four miles west from Mahsamah Station, which, only
a few days previous to this action, was captured from the Egyptians by
General Drury Lowe. The Egyptians had established a camp at that place,
and, after the capture, the Household Cavalry and the Dragoon Guards were
stationed there, under the command of General Drury Lowe, as a reserve
to the small force that held Kassassin Lock, an important fortified
position occupied by General Graham. The enemy, under the rebel-leader
Arabi, held the strongly fortified camp of Tel-el-Kebir, about twelve
miles west from Kassassin. Arabi’s stronghold (Tel-el-Kebir) was stormed
and captured by the English under their skilful Commander-in-chief Sir
Garnet Wolseley (now Lord Wolseley of Cairo), on Wednesday, September 13,
when the rebel-army was totally beaten, and the Egyptian war brought to a
successful issue.

THE BATTLE OF KASSASSIN.

                                          3 o’clock in the morning.

Scarcely had the Cavalry unsaddled, and[2] horses and men begun to eat,
when the[3] sound of artillery was heard (S. 4, N. 4, +man+) again at
Kassassin, and by[4] the heavy _and_ continuous roar[5] it was evident[6]
that this time the attack was[7] in earnest. Again the wearied men
saddled their no less weary horses and[8] prepared to advance. The[9]
sun was still beating down fiercely even at that late hour, and the hot
withering[10] wind was raising[11] the sand clouds so high that it was
impossible to see what was going[12] on, but through the dust and haze
numerous[13] jets of smoke from the guns were visible.

The cannonade increased[14] in violence, and the Cavalry moved[15] away
to the right, the[16] Artillery following them, and pressed[17] round
towards the flank of the enemy’s Infantry. With[18] the movement of such
masses of men and horses the dust rose over the whole scene thicker than
ever, and it was impossible to obtain[19] more than a general idea of
what was going on; while the sun set in[20] a red glare over the sandy
plain.

The Cavalry pushed[21] still further to the right until[22] hidden from
the enemy by some low sand hills, and[23] then goaded their weary horses
into as fast a trot as the heavy sand and their weary condition would
permit.

It was evident that it was the General’s intention to repeat the tactics
of the previous fight, and that he meant[24] to get round the enemy’s
rear. It was a striking proof of his confidence in[25] his troops that
(S. 66, N. 15), with[26] tired horses and night approaching, he should
attempt this manœuvre against an enemy of unknown strength and with[27]
fresh horses. Against any other enemy it would have been rash[28], but
the result proved that General Drury Lowe did not over-estimate the
fighting powers[29] of his men.

THE BATTLE OF KASSASSIN.

III.


Soon[1] darkness came down rapidly upon us. The rattle and roar of[2]
combat on[3] our left never ceased, and it was evident that the two
thousand Infantry[4] at Kassassin were hard pressed. Presently[5] the
moonlight streamed palely over the grey sand, but the clouds of dust
obscured[6] the advancing horsemen, who sometimes trotted, sometimes[7]
walked.

By about seven o’clock we had got in the rear of the firing[8], and[9]
wheeled in that direction, advancing[10] very slowly to[11] allow the
Artillery to[12] come up. We could see the flashes of[13] the enemy’s
artillery _gleam_ on the horizon like the flicker of incessant summer
lightning[14].

We slowly drew[15] nearer to the scene of conflict. It was almost
dark[16], but, unfortunately, we showed up[17] a black mass against the
bright moonlit sky and ground[18], and[19] the sudden rush of shell
through the air, followed[20] by an explosion far in our rear, showed
that the enemy had at last discovered us. They[21] were about fifteen
hundred yards[22] away, and[23] we saw nine flashes, one after another,
at short intervals, spurt out, no[24] longer like sheet lightning, but
in angry jets of flame. Almost simultaneously the sky above us seemed
to[24] be torn in pieces as by (= through) a mighty hurricane. Shells
screamed[25] and burst[26], and shrapnel bullets[27] tore up the sand on
either side of us.

The brigade now moved[28] to the right to[29] disconcert their aim,
and the next salvo of shell missed us. We moved quickly forward, and
the gunners again saw us, and the shells burst over and around. Yet,
strangely[30], but few were hit, though it seemed as if the storm[31]
would mow men and horses down by squadrons[32].

_Section 176._

THE BATTLE OF KASSASSIN.

IV.


Now[1] tiny flashes, with the sharp ping of bullets, told that the
enemy’s Infantry were also at work, whilst[2] a horse here and a man
there dropped[3] in the ranks.

The battery having (S. 30, N. 4) by this time come up, the Cavalry
moved[4] to the right, in order to[5] allow them to come into action, and
_in a_ few seconds, after taking up their ground, our guns spoke[6] out
their answer to the enemy’s fire.

The Cavalry now advanced[7] from the left, the[8] 7th Dragoons leading.
Under[9] cover of these the Life Guards formed for a charge, and[10] by
word of command the Dragoons opened[11] right and left to allow them to
pass. Already Herbert Stewart, General Drury Lowe’s brigade-major, had
passed[12] down the line the word: “The Cavalry are to charge the guns!”
Sir Baker Russell was in front (= at the head), and shouted: “Now we have
them. Charge!”

Away[13] went the long line, disappearing[14] almost instantly in the
darkness and dust, and _away_ behind them went[15] the 7th Dragoons,
keeping[16] (S. 16, N. 4) on either flank of the Guards.

We[17], remaining in the rear, had the full benefit of the storm and shot
which was to greet the advancing horsemen (+Reiterei+, f.) and of whom
from (S. 102, N. 4) this moment we saw no more till the battle was over;
_and_ only (S. 109, N. 5) then we learned[18] what they had done.

Led by Baker Russell, they charged[19] straight at the guns, sabring[20]
the gunners as they passed, and[21] dashing into and cutting down the
flying Infantry beyond them. Russell’s horse was shot under him, but he
seized another and kept with[22] his men.

The battle was ended[23] at a stroke, and a scene of wild confusion
ensued[24]; some guns were[25] still firing, bodies[26] of Infantry still
kept up a fusillade, and numerous bodies[27] of horses and men dotted the
moonlit plain.

Being now separated altogether from the Cavalry, with[28] the enemy
intervening between us, myself and two companions endeavoured to find
our[29] way round to Kassassin. It was an adventurous ride, for several
shells burst near us, but before we reached the camp, the conflict was at
an end.

[1] = At (+In+) this moment (App. § 14) flashes of lightning (+kleine

_Section 177._

THE BATTLE OF KASSASSIN.

V.


The Infantry there[1] had indeed had a hot time of it[2]. Hundreds of
shells had (S. 29, N. 3) burst in the confined[3] space, and the shelter
trenches[4] afforded but _an_ insufficient protection. On the left
of the position[5], next to the Canal, were[6] the Marine Artillery,
then came the 46th, and next[7] to them the 84th[8], the[9] slight
earthworks sweeping round again in a semi-circle almost to the Canal.
The Mounted[10] Infantry were in front under Captain Pigott, who[11] has
received a wound, having been shot through the thigh.

The Egyptians came on with great bravery, _and_ in spite of the[12] heavy
like of our men[13], were rapidly gaining ground, and would soon have
rushed[14] into the entrenchments, when the roar of our guns on[15] their
left rear, followed[16] by the rush of our Cavalry, proved[17] too much
for them, and from (S. 102, N. 4) that moment they thought only of flight.

Our casualties are surprisingly[18] small considering[19] the fire to
which our men were exposed. Lieutenant Edwards, of the Mounted Infantry,
was[20] shot in the arm, Surgeon-Major[21] Shaw, of the 46th, was[22]
killed, and _some_ ten or a dozen men, but, fortunately, the Remington
bullet wounds rather than kills; the hospital was crowded[23] with
wounded men.

About 10 o’clock the Cavalry came in[24] in high spirits over their
brilliant achievement. Many, of course, are missing in the darkness, but
will, no doubt, turn up[25] in the morning. Upon their[26] return from
the pursuit they[27] were unable to find the guns over which they had
charged, but these[28] will doubtless be discovered at sunrise. After
learning from them[29] the events[30] of the charge, I[31] started to
ride here to get off[32] my despatches,—a[33] distance of twenty-four
miles. This solitary ride over the dismal desert by moonlight was not[34]
the least exciting part of an exciting day.

Late[35] as it was, I found at (+auf+) the different posts the men[36]
busy at work entrenching, and met troops also on[37] their march to
reinforce those at the front.

The enemy’s force[38] _engaged_ was estimated at 13,000. The Egyptians
fought well until our Cavalry and guns took[39] them in the rear, and,
had[40] it not been for the gallantry of the defenders of Kassassin,
would[41] have carried the position before our reinforcements came upon
the scene.

At[42] the time I left, the losses were unknown, but were[43] supposed to
be about twenty killed and a hundred wounded.

As[44] I am writing, Sir Garnet Wolseley and[45] the entire army are

HOW THE DUKE OF WELLINGTON WAS DECEIVED.


“I (S. 115, N. 1) got famously taken in[1] on that occasion,” said the
Duke of Wellington once. “The troops had[2] taken to plundering a good
deal. It was necessary to[3] stop it, and I issued an order announcing[4]
that the[5] first man taken in the act should be hanged upon the spot.
One day, just as we were sitting[6] down to dinner, three men[7] were
brought to the door of the tent by the provost. They had been taken in[8]
the act of plundering, and I had nothing for it[9] but to command that
they (S. 4, N. 4, +man+) should be taken away and hanged in some place
where they might be seen by the whole column in its march next day. I
had _a good_ many guests with[10] me on that day, and among the rest, I
think, Lord Nugent. They[11] seemed dreadfully shocked, and could not
eat _their dinner_. I did not eat myself, but, as I told them, I could
not indulge my feelings[12]; I must do my duty. Well[13], the dinner
went off rather gravely; and next morning, sure enough[14], three men in
uniform were seen hanging (S. 78, N. 14, _B_) from the branches of a tree
close to the high road. It was a terrible example, which produced[15] the
desired effect, for there was no more plundering. Some months afterwards
I learned that one of my staff[16] had taken counsel with Dr. Hume, and
as three men had (S. 29, N. 3) just died in the hospital, they had hung
them[17] up and let the three culprits return to their regiments.”

“Were you not very angry, Duke[18]?”

“Well[19], I suppose I was at first; but[20] as I had no wish to take
the poor fellows’ lives and only wanted the example, and as the example
had the desired effect (S. 27, N. 8), my anger soon died out[21], and
I confess to you that[22] I am very glad now that the three lives were
spared.”—HISTORICAL ANECDOTES.

A LETTER FROM DR. HENRY DANSON TO[1] MR. JOHN FORSTER, ON[2] CHARLES
DICKENS’S[3] SCHOOL-LIFE.

I.


My impression is[4] that I was a schoolfellow of Dickens for nearly
two years. He left[5] before me, I think about fifteen years of age.
The school, called (S. 7, N. 3, _B_) _the_ Wellington Academy, was in
_the_ Hampstead Road at the north-east corner of Granby Street. The
school-house was afterwards taken down[6] on account of the London and
North-Western Railway. It was considered at the time[7] a very superior
sort of school, one of the best indeed[8] in that part of London; but it
was most shamefully mismanaged[9], and the boys[10] made but very little
progress. The proprietor, Mr. Jones, was a Welshman[11]; a most[12]
ignorant fellow, and a mere tyrant, whose chief employment was[13] to
scourge the boys. Dickens has[14] given a very lively account of this
place in his paper _entitled_ “Our School,” but it is very mythical in
many respects, and[15] more especially in the compliment he pays in it
to himself. I do not remember that Dickens distinguished himself in
any way[16], or carried off _any_ prizes. My belief is[17] that he did
not learn Greek or Latin there, and you will remember[18] there is no
allusion to the classics in _any of_ his writings. He was a handsome,
curly-headed lad[19], full of animation and animal spirits, and[20]
probably was connected with every mischievous prank in the school.

[1] +an.+

[2] +über.+

[3] +~Charles Dickens~, geboren den 7. Febr. 1812 zu Portsmouth,
gestorben den 9. Juni 1870 auf seinem Landsitze bei London, begann seine
schriftstellerische Thätigkeit unter dem angenommenen Namen Boz, welcher
ihn schnell berühmt machte. Er begründete seinen Ruf als englischer
Humorist durch die+ ‘Sketches of London’ (1836), +und namentlich durch
die+ ‘Pickwick Papers’ (1837), +welches unstreitig das beliebteste, aber
auch vielleicht das beste seiner zahlreichen Werke ist. Er gründete
1845 die Zeitung+ ‘Daily News’, +sowie 1850 die Zeitschrift+ ‘Household
Words’, +welche seit 1860 den Titel+ ‘All the year round’ +führt. Er
besuchte zweimal, im Jahre 1842 und 1868, die Vereinigten Staaten
von Nord Amerika, von wo er das zweite Mal durch seine vielbesuchten
Vorlesungen aus seinen eigenen Werken eine reiche Ernte heimführte. Von
seinen späteren Werken sind+ ‘Oliver Twist’, ‘Nicholas Nickleby’, ‘David
Copperfield’, ‘Dombey and Son’, ‘Martin Chuzzlewit’, +und+ ‘A Christmas
Carol’ +die bekanntesten und besten. Es mag interessant sein, hier zu

scourging propensity; in fact, together with myself, he was only a
day-pupil, and[2] with these there was a wholesome fear of tales being
carried home to the parents. His personal appearance at that time[3] is
vividly brought home to me in the portrait of him taken a few years later
by Mr. Lawrence. He resided (S. 116, N. 17) with[4] his friends, in a
very small house in a street leading out of Seymour Street, north of Mr.
Judkin’s chapel.

Depend on it, he was _quite_ a self-made man, and his wonderful knowledge
and command (+Beherrschung+, f.) of the English language must[5] have
been acquired by long and patient study after leaving his last school.

I have no recollection of the boy you name[6]. Dickens’s chief[7]
associates were, I think[8], Tobin, Mr. Thomas, Bray, and myself. The
first named[9] was his chief ally, and his acquaintance with him appears
to have continued many[10] years _afterwards_. About that time[11] the
Penny and Saturday magazines (S. 71, N. 2) were published weekly, and
_were_ greedily read by (S. 106, N. 23) us. We kept bees, white mice, and
other living things, clandestinely[12], in our desks, and the mechanical
arts were a good deal cultivated, in[13] the shape of coach-building, and
making pumps and boats, the motive power of which was the white mice.

I think at that time Dickens took to writing[14] small tales, and we
had a sort _of_ club for[15] lending and circulating them. Dickens was
also very strong[16] in using a sort of lingo, which made us[17] quite
unintelligible to bystanders.

A LETTER FROM DR. HENRY DANSON TO MR. JOHN FORSTER, ON CHARLES DICKENS’S
SCHOOL-LIFE.

III.


We were very strong, too, in theatricals[1]. We mounted[2] small
theatres, and got up very gorgeous scenery to[3] illustrate “The Miller
and his Men,” and other pieces. I remember the[4] present _Mr._ Beverley,
the scene painter, assisted us in this (S. 4, N. 5). Dickens was always
the leader[5] at these plays, which were occasionally presented with
much solemnity before an audience[6] of boys, and in _the_ presence of
the ushers. My brother, assisted by Dickens, got up[7] “The Miller and
his Men” in a very gorgeous form. Master[8] Beverley constructed the
mill for us, in such a way[9] that it could tumble to pieces with the
assistance of crackers. At one representation, the fireworks in the last
scene, ending with the destruction of the mill, were so _very_ real[10]
that the police interfered, and knocked violently at the door. Dickens’s
after-taste for theatricals might have had[11] its origin in these small
affairs.

I quite[12] remember Dickens[13] one day heading us in Drummond Street
in pretending to be poor boys, and asking the passers-by for charity,
especially old ladies, one of whom told[14] us she had no money for
beggar-boys.

On these adventures, and especially when the old ladies were quite
staggered[15] by the impudence of the demand, Dickens would explode with
laughter and then take to his heels.

I met him one Sunday morning shortly after he had left the school,
and[16] we very piously attended the morning service at Seymour Street
chapel. I am sorry to say[17] Master[18] Dickens did not attend in the
slightest degree to the service, but (S. 6, N. 10) incited me to laughter
by declaring (S. 111, N. 6) his dinner was ready, and the potatoes would
be spoiled[19]. In fact, he behaved in such a manner[20] that it was
lucky for us we were not ejected from the chapel.—FROM J. FORSTER’S “LIFE

_Section 182._

SIR JOSEPH PAXTON[1].


Sir Joseph Paxton was acting as gardener to[2] the Duke of Devonshire
when the Committee of the Exhibition of 1851 advertised for plans of a
building. The architects and engineers seem to have been very much at
fault[3] when Paxton submitted his design, and its novelty and remarkable
suitability for the purposes intended, at once secured its adoption[4].
The first sketch was made upon a piece of blotting-paper in the rooms of
the Midland Railway Company[5] at Derby; and the first rough[6] sketch
indicated[7] the principal features of the building as accurately as the
most finished drawings which were afterwards prepared. The great[8] idea
of the Crystal Palace was as palpable[9] on the blotting-paper as if it
had been set forth in all the glory of water-colour and gold-framing[10].

Was it a sudden idea,—an inspiration of genius[11],—flashing upon the
mind of one[12] who, though no architect, must at least[13] have been
something like a poet?—Not at all[14]. The architect of the Crystal
Palace was simply a man who cultivated opportunities[15],—a laborious,
painstaking[16] man, whose life had been a life of labour, of diligent
self-improvement, of assiduous cultivation of knowledge[17]. As[18] Sir
Joseph Paxton himself has shown, in a lecture before the Society of Arts,
the idea was slowly and patiently elaborated by experiments extending
over many years[19]. The Exhibition of 1851 merely afforded him _the_
opportunity of putting forward his idea[20]—the right thing at the right
time—and the result was what we have seen.—S. SMILES, “SELF-HELP.”

[1] +~Joseph Paxton~, geb. den 3. Aug. 1803, gest. den 8. Juni 1865,
wurde zunächst Kunstgärtner beim Herzog von Devonshire, zeichnete sich
jedoch bald durch seine genialen Schöpfungen so sehr aus, daß der Herzog
ihn zum Gartendirektor und Verwalter seiner großartigen Besitzung in
Chatsworth ernannte. Die wundervollen Gartenanlagen und Gewächshäuser
daselbst legen noch heute Zeugnis ab von seiner Genialität. Das große
Gewächshaus, welches aus Eisen und Glas erbaut und 300 Fuß lang und 140
Fuß breit ist, diente ihm später als Grundlage des von ihm eingereichten
Entwurfes für das Ausstellungsgebäude von 1851 im Hyde Park zu London
und des später von ihm in Sydenham errichteten Krystalpalastes. Seine
Verdienste um die große Weltindustrieausstellung von 1851 wurden von
der Königin dadurch anerkannt, daß sie ihm die Ritterwürde verlieh. Sir
Joseph Paxton wurde im Jahre 1854 zum Parlamentsmitgliede für Coventry
gewählt und hat sich um die Baukunst und das Eisenbahnwesen manche
Verdienste erworben. Er ist auch der Verfasser vieler Zeitschriften und

REBECCA DESCRIBES THE SIEGE OF TORQUILSTONE (App. § 5) TO THE WOUNDED
IVANHOE[1].

I.


“And I must lie here like a bed-ridden[2] monk,” exclaimed Ivanhoe,
“while the game[3] that gives me[4] freedom or death is played out by
_the hands of_ others! Look from the window[5] once again, kind maiden,
but beware that you are not marked by the archers[6]. Look out once more,
and tell me if[7] they yet advance[8] to the storm.”

With patient[9] courage, strengthened by the interval which she had
employed in mental devotion[10], Rebecca again took post[11] at the
lattice, sheltering herself[12], however, by means of a large _and_
ancient shield so as not to be visible from beneath[13].

“What dost thou see, Rebecca?” again demanded the wounded knight.

“Nothing but the[14] cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle mine
eyes[15], and to hide the bowmen who shoot them.”

“That cannot endure[16],” said Ivanhoe; “if they press not right on[17]
to carry the castle by pure force of arms (S. 27, N. 8), the archery
may[18] avail but little against stone walls and bulwarks. Look for[19]
the Black Knight, fair Rebecca, and see how he bears himself[20]; for as
the leader _is_, so will his followers be[21].”

“I see him not,” said Rebecca.

“Foul craven[22]!” exclaimed Ivanhoe; “does he blench[23] from the helm
when the wind blows highest[24]?”

[1] =Ivanhoe=, a novel by Sir Walter Scott, is the most brilliant and
splendid of romances in the English language. Rebecca, the Jewess, was
Scott’s favourite character. The Scene is laid in England in the reign
of Richard I., who assumes the name of the ‘Black Knight’ in this story,
and we are introduced to Robin Hood in Sherwood Forest, banquets in Saxon
halls, tournaments, and all the pomp of ancient chivalry. Sir Wilfred
Ivanhoe is the favourite of Richard I. and disinherited son of the Saxon
Cedric of Rotherwood. Having distinguished himself as a crusader, he
returns to England and, disguised as a palmer, goes to Rotherwood, where
he meets Rowéna, his father’s ward, with whom he is in love; but, through
his separation from his true love, we see him more as the friend of
Rebecca and her father, Isaac of York, to both of whom he shows repeated
acts of kindness, and completely wins the affections of the beautiful
Jewess, who, by her gentle, meek, yet noble and high-toned disposition,
quite throws into the shade her more successful rival Rowéna. In the
grand tournament at Ashby Ivanhoe appears as the ‘Disinherited Knight’,
and overthrows all comers. He is, however, wounded, and carried from the
crowded lists by Rebecca’s servants. After having attended to his wounds,
Rebecca and her father are about to transport their friend in a litter
to Doncaster, when they are surprised by a number of armed men, headed
by the Templar Brian de Bois-Guilbert, who take them prisoners and bring
them, along with Cedric and Rowéna, who likewise have been made captives,
to Torquilstone, the Castle of Front-de-Bœuf, Ivanhoe’s enemy. During
their imprisonment the castle is besieged by the Black Knight, who, in
his adventurous spirit, having joined a band of yeomen and outlaws,
demands the deliverance of the prisoners. The castle falls into the hands
of the besiegers, Front-de-Bœuf perishing in the flames of the burning
castle; Ring Richard pleads for Ivanhoe to Cedric, reconciles the father
to his son, and the young knight marries Rowéna.

“He blenches not! he blenches not!” said Rebecca, “I see him now; he
leads a body of men[1] close under the outer barrier[2] of the barbican.
They pull down the piles and palisades; they hew down the barriers with
axes.—His high black plume floats abroad over the throng[3], like a
raven over the field of the slain[4].—They have made a breach in the
barriers—they rush in—they are thrust back! Front-de-Bœuf heads the
defenders; I see his gigantic form above the press[5]. They throng[6]
again to (S. 72, N. 4) the breach, and the pass is disputed hand to
hand and man to man[7]. God of Jacob! it is the meeting of two fierce
tides—the conflict of two oceans moved by adverse winds[8]!”

She turned her head from the lattice, as if (S. 27, N. 7) unable longer
to endure a sight so terrible (S. 128, N. 11).

“Look forth again, Rebecca,” said Ivanhoe, mistaking[9] the cause of her
retiring; “the archery must in some degree[10] have ceased, since they
are now fighting hand to hand.—Look again, there is[11] now less danger.”

Rebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed: “Help, O
prophets of the law! Front-de-Bœuf and the Black Knight fight hand to
hand on[12] the breach, amid[13] the roar of their followers[14], who
watch[15] the progress of the strife.—Heaven strike[16] (App. § 34)

“Who is down?” cried Ivanhoe; “for[1] our dear Lady’s sake, tell me who
has fallen?”

“The Black Knight,” answered Rebecca faintly[2]; then instantly again
shouted with joyful eagerness[3]: “But[4] no—but no!—the name of the Lord
of hosts be blessed[5]!—he is on foot[6] again, and fights as if there
were twenty men’s strength in his single arm[7].—His sword is broken—he
snatches[8] an axe from a yeoman—he presses[9] Front-de-Bœuf with blow
on blow.—The giant stoops and totters like an oak under the steel of the
woodman[10]—he falls—he falls!”

“Front-de-Bœuf?” exclaimed Ivanhoe.

“Front-de-Bœuf!” answered the Jewess; “his men[11] rush to

Templar[13]—their united force compels the champion[14] to pause.—They

“The assailants have won[16] the barriers, have they not?” said Ivanhoe.

“They have—they have[17]!” exclaimed Rebecca—“and they press[18] the
besieged hard upon the outer wall; some plant ladders[19], some swarm
like bees (S. 3, N. 2) and endeavour to ascend upon the shoulders of
each other[20]—down go[21] stones, beams, and trunks of trees upon their

“Think not of that (S. 4, N. 5, _B_),” said Ivanhoe; “this is[1] no time
for such thoughts. Who yield? Who push their way[2]?”

“The ladders are thrown down,” replied Rebecca shuddering; “the soldiers
lie grovelling[3] under them like crushed reptiles. The besieged have the
better[4].”

“Saint George, strike[5] for us!” exclaimed the Knight; “do the false
yeomen give way[6]?”

“No!” exclaimed Rebecca, “they bear[7] themselves right yeomanly—the
Black Knight approaches the postern with his huge axe—the thundering
blows which he deals[8] you may[9] hear _them_ above all the din[10] and
shouts of the battle.—Stones and beams are hailed down[11] on the bold
champion—he regards them no more than if they were[12] thistle-down[13]
or feathers!”

“By Saint George,” said Ivanhoe, raising (S. 111, N. 6) himself joyfully
on his couch, “methought[14] there was (S. 82, N. 7, and App. § 33) but
one man in England that[15] might do such a deed!”

“The postern gate shakes[16],” continued Rebecca; “it crashes—it is
splintered by[17] his blows—they rush in—the outwork is won[18].—O God,
they hurl the defenders from the battlements—they throw them into the
moat.—O men, if ye[19] be indeed men, spare them that can resist no
longer!”

“The bridge—the bridge which communicates with the castle—have they
won[20] that pass?” exclaimed Ivanhoe.

“No,” replied Rebecca, “the Templar has destroyed the plank on which they
crossed[21]—few[22] of the defenders escaped with him into the castle—the
shrieks and cries[23] which you hear tell the fate of the others.—Alas! I
see it is still more difficult to look upon[24] victory (S. 3, N. 2) than

THE FAVOURITE HARES[1].

I.


In the year 1774, being (S. 55, N. 1) much indisposed both in mind and
body[2], incapable of diverting myself either[3] with company or books,
and yet in a condition[4] that made some diversion necessary[5], I was
glad of anything that would engage my attention[6], without fatiguing it.

The children of a neighbour of mine had a leveret given them for a
play-thing[7]; it was at that time about three months old. Understanding
better how to tease the poor creature than to feed it, and soon becoming
weary of their charge[8], they readily consented[9] that their father,
who saw it pining[10] and growing leaner every day, should offer[11] it
to my acceptance. I was willing enough to take the prisoner under my
protection, perceiving that (S. 66, N. 15), in the management[12] of such
an animal, and in the attempt to tame it, I should find just that sort
of employment which my case required[13]. It was soon known among the
neighbours that I was pleased[14] with the present, and the consequence
of it was, that[15] in a short time I had as many leverets offered to me
as would have stocked a paddock[16]. I undertook the care[17] of three,
which it is necessary that I should here distinguish by the names I
gave them[18]: Puss, Tiny, and Bess. Notwithstanding the two feminine
appellatives, I must inform[19] you they were all males.

Immediately commencing carpenter, I built[1] them houses to sleep in.
Each leveret had a separate apartment, so contrived[2] that it could be
kept perfectly sweet and clean[3]. In the daytime[4] the animals had the
range[5] of the hall, and at night[6] retired each to his own bed, never
intruding into that of another[7].

Puss grew presently familiar, would leap[8] into my lap, raise himself[9]
upon his hinder feet, and bite the hair from my temples. He would
suffer[10] me to take him up, and to carry him about in my arms, and
has more than once fallen fast asleep upon my knees. He was ill three
days, during which time I nursed him, kept him apart from his fellows,
that[11] they might not molest him (for, like many other wild animals,
they persecute[12] one of their own species that is sick), and by
constant care[13], and with a variety of herbs, restored him to perfect
health[14]. No creature could be more grateful than (S. 104, N. 19) my
patient after his recovery, a sentiment which he most significantly
expressed by licking[15] my hand, first the back of it[16], then the
palm, then every finger separately[17], then[18] between all _the_
fingers, as if (S. 27, N. 7) anxious to leave no part of it unsaluted; a

Finding him extremely tractable, I made it my[1] custom to carry him
always after breakfast into the garden, where he hid himself generally
under the leaves of a vine, sleeping[2] or chewing the cud till evening;
in the leaves also of that vine he found a favourite repast[3]. I had
not long habituated him to _this taste of_ liberty, before[4] he began
to be impatient for the return of the time[5] when he might enjoy it[6].
He would invite me to the garden[7] by drumming (S. 111, N. 6) upon my
knee, and by (S. 185, N. 26) a look of such expression[8] as it was not
possible to misinterpret. If the[9] rhetoric did not immediately succeed,
he would take the skirt of my coat (S. 36, N. 7, _A_) between his teeth,
and pull it with all _his_ force[10]. Thus Puss might be said to be
perfectly tamed[11]; the shyness of his nature was done away[12], and, on
the whole[13], it was visible by many symptoms, which I have not room to
enumerate[14], that he was happier in human society than when (S. 27, N.
7) shut up with[15] his natural companions.

Not so Tiny; upon him the kindest[16] treatment had not the least
effect. He too was sick, and in his sickness had an equal share of my
attention[17]; but when, after his recovery, I took the liberty to
stroke him, he would grunt, strike with his fore feet, spring forward,
and bite[18]. He was, however[19], entertaining in his way; even his
surliness was matter of mirth[20], and in his play he preserved such
an air of gravity[21], and performed his feats with such solemnity of
manner[22], that in (+an+) him too I had an agreeable companion.

Bess, who died soon after he was full grown[1], and whose death was
occasioned by his being turned (S. 161, N. 21, and S. 87, N. 6) into his
box, which had been washed, while it was yet damp[2], was a hare of
great humour and drollery[3]. Puss was tamed by gentle usage; Tiny was
not to be tamed at all; and Bess had a[4] courage and confidence that
made him tame from the beginning[5]. I always admitted them into the
parlour after supper, when (S. 131, N. 4), the[6] carpet affording their
feet a firm hold, they would frisk, _and_ bound, and play _a_ thousand
gambols, in[7] which Bess, being remarkably strong and fearless, was
always superior to the rest. One evening, the cat being in the room, it
had the hardiness to pat Bess upon the cheek, an indignity which[8] he
resented by drumming upon her (S. 43, N. 9, _B_) back with such violence
that the cat was happy to escape from _under_ his paws, and[9] hide
herself.

I describe the animals as having had each a character of his own[10].
Such they were in fact[11], and their countenances were so expressive
of that character, that, when I looked only on the face of either, I

PRINCE BISMARCK’S HOME[1].


After crossing the threshold I found myself in a small, plain
apartment—the reception-room—in the centre of which stands a simple
little polished table with four legs. This is a relic of historical
significance. A brass plate let into the square top[2] bears _the_
following inscription: “At this table the preliminaries of peace between
Germany and France were signed, February 26th, 1871, at Versailles, No.
14 Rue de Provence.” In the centre of the table is[3] a round piece
_of_ green cloth, and on it are visible a number of spots[4] caused by
(S. 185, N. 26) the drippings[5] from the candles used on the momentous
occasion of the negotiations between the Chancellor and Jules Favre[6].
The table was the property of the lady in whose house the Chancellor
was quartered[7], and of whom he bought it. In the same room stands a
gigantic wardrobe richly sculptured[8], and a second wardrobe (S. 5, N.
2), according to Castellan (S. 10, N. 2) Hackmack’s explanation, was
made from[9] the wood of a linden tree, in the shade of which Prince
Bismarck, when a[10] merry student at Göttingen, had frequently reposed.
The adjoining room is the Prince’s study. A bookcase contains a small
library[11] for immediate use and for reference, among its books being a
French account of[12] the peace negotiations of 1871. The writing-desk
occupies the centre of the room. A polished fire-screen, highly[13]
ornamented and of Asiatic origin, is a present from the Chinese Embassy
in Berlin. On the mantel-piece stands a bronze statuette, about three
feet high, representing the Grand Elector—a present from the Emperor.
A slip of paper attached to the Marshal’s baton in the Elector’s
outstretched hand, bears the Imperial autograph[14]: “To[15] Prince
Bismarck—Christmas, 1880,—W.” On the wall, behind the statuette, hangs,
in a richly gilt frame, a painting by[16] Hünten, representing the
attack of dragoons of the guard on French infantry at Mars-la-Tour; the
Chancellor’s two sons, Herbert and William, being[17] in the midst of the
fight.—THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE LONDON “DAILY NEWS.”

ROYAL BENEVOLENCE.


Frederick the Great, King of Prussia[1], once rang the bell[2] of
his cabinet; but as nobody answered[3], he opened the door of the
ante-chamber, and there found his page fast asleep[4] upon a chair[5].
He went up to awake him, but, coming nearer, he observed a paper in his
pocket, upon which something was written[6]. This excited his curiosity.
He pulled it out, and found that it was a letter from the page’s mother,
the contents of which were nearly as follows[7]: “She returned her
son many thanks[8] for the money he had saved out of his salary and
sent to her, which had proved a very timely assistance[9]. God would
certainly reward him for it, and if he continued to serve God and his
king faithfully and conscientiously, he could not fail of success[10] and
prosperity in this world[11].” Upon reading (S. 55, N. 1) this, the king
stepped softly into his closet, fetched a rouleau[12] _of_ ducats, and
put it with the letter into the page’s pocket (S. 43, N. 9, _B_). He then
rang again till the page awoke and came into his closet. “You have[13]
been asleep, I suppose?” said the king. The page could not deny it,
stammered out an excuse[14], put, in his embarrassment, his hand into his
pocket, and felt the rouleau _of_ ducats. He immediately pulled it out,
turned[15] pale, and looked at the king with tears in his eyes. “What is
the matter with you?” said the king. “Oh!” replied the page, “somebody
has contrived[16] my ruin: I know nothing of this money.” “What God
bestows[17],” resumed the king, “He bestows in sleep. Send the money to
your mother (App. § 5), give my respects to her[18], and inform her that
I will take care[19] of both her and you.”—W. BUCK.

TELEGRAPHY (S. 3, N. 2) AMONG BIRDS.


I watch[1] a flock[2] _of_ crows who, by some own correspondent of
theirs, have learned that Farmer Blyth will hold a ploughing match on
his grounds[3], and have in consequence summoned their brethren[4] to

and they had no thought of earthly things[7]! Yet point[8] a gun, or
anything like it towards them, and in a moment (App. § 14) the young
birds even whose backs seemed turned to you[9] will give a flutter[10] of
their wings, which appears an involuntary struggle[11], but in reality
is as significant a danger-signal as a red flag on a railway[12], and is
sufficient to clear the field. Nor [= And yet ... not] are those crows

THE HANSE[1].

I.


About the end of the twelfth century commerce began to extend towards
the north of Europe. Along the German shores of the Baltic (S. 36, N. 7,
_A_) sprang up[2] thriving towns, which sent out ships to (S. 72, N. 4)
Russia, Norway, England, and other parts, and exchanged the raw materials
which they thus acquired (S. 48, N. 6) for the merchandise of Southern
Europe and the Levant, which reached them both by land and sea[3].
Before[4] _the_ middle of the thirteenth century, this trade had become
so valuable as to excite[5] the rapacity, not only of numerous pirates
who infested[6] the seas, but[7] of princes (S. 3, N. 2) and nobles, who
exacted arbitrary and excessive tolls.

To defend their interests against these assailants, the chief[8]
ports entered into a league, binding themselves[9] to [+zu+] _afford_
mutual aid and protection. Lübeck and Hamburg stood at the head of
this association; Bremen ranked next[10]; and one after another the
principal towns gave in their adhesion, the movement spreading from
east to west[11]. The numbers of the league[12] fluctuated, but at one
time it is known (S. 4, N. 4, +man+) to have comprised more than ninety
different towns. In the fourteenth century its authority[13] extended
greatly, for[14] it rallied around it the chief commercial towns of the
interior, such as Cologne, Dortmund, Münster, Brunswick, Magdeburg, etc.
The Hanse had for its object the protection and development of commerce,
the maintenance of existing and the acquisition of new privileges[15].
The association was governed by a Diet[16], to which each town sent
representatives, and which met once in three years[17] in Lübeck. As the
confederation expanded, it became necessary to divide it into several
provinces[18], of which the capitals were Lübeck, Cologne, Brunswick, and
Dantzic.

THE HANSE.

II.


In Russia the Hanse found a valuable and most virgin field[1] for its
commercial enterprises. Thence it drew[2] large supplies of timber, flax,
hemp, ropes, skins, furs, wax, and tallow; bestowing in return[3] (for
the trade was only one of barter), salt, herrings, and coarse cloth,
for the mass of the peasants; and[4] brocades, jewels, wines, and other
articles of luxury, for the wealthy boyards and princes. A factory at
Novgorod conducted these transactions. Another factory at Bergen placed
the Hanse in direct contact[5] with Norway and Sweden. This was an
establishment of considerable magnitude, comprising twenty-two courts,
and serving not only as a lodging for the staff of agents and clerks[6],
but as a warehouse[7] _for the goods_. The chief exports from this
quarter were[8] timber, resin, sperm oil, _and_, above all[9], salted
fish—a (S. 53, N. 9) commodity[10] in great demand at a time when Europe
was still Catholic and fasted faithfully on the appointed days. The Hanse
had[11] two other large factories, one in Bruges, employing three hundred
agents, and another in London.

Year by year[12] the Hanse grew more rich and powerful. New branches of
business were opened up, new factories _were_ founded. Kings and princes
were glad[13] to be on good terms with so influential a body. Ambassadors
from the Kings of England, France, Sweden, and Denmark, and even from
the Emperor himself, waited on[14] the Diet, to ask[15] favours, and
to offer trading privileges in return. The original object of the
league—mutual protection—was reasonable and legitimate, but was gradually
expanded into[16] a policy of forcible aggression and imperious monopoly.
Not only were foreigners, in[17] their voyages to (S. 72, N. 4) the Hanse
towns, compelled to employ Hanseatic ships, but[18] the commerce of the
north-east and west of Europe was almost exclusively in the hands of the
league.

THE HANSE.

III.


There were no bounds to its greed and selfishness[1]. It did its utmost
to crush all growing trade[2], navigation, and even manufactures,
which in the least interfered with its gains[3]. It warned away[4] all
strangers[5] from the Baltic; and when it found them there, it seized
and destroyed their vessels[6]. In order to maintain this monopoly,
it[7] was ready to make[8] the greatest sacrifices, to equip fleets, and
sustain long and costly campaigns. With Denmark it waged a desperate
war; and it also came into collision[9] with Sweden and Norway. From[10]
these contests it came off victorious, and the whole of Scandinavia
was compelled to acknowledge its commercial supremacy[11]. It[12] had
a rupture also with the Netherlands, whose flag it banished from the
Baltic[13].

These unbounded pretensions naturally excited a great deal of ill
feeling[14] against the Hanse, and, in the end, proved fatal[15] to it.
One after another[16], the markets which it had been accustomed to regard
as its own private estates, threw off their allegiance, and admitted[17]
the traders of other nations. Then[18] _it was that_ the league began
to suffer in another way from its narrow-minded selfishness. As long
as it had exclusive command of[19] foreign sources of supply, it did
not trouble itself to develop the resources of Germany—indeed it rather
endeavoured[20] to repress them, when it thought that others were likely
to profit by them; but when one by one its monopolies exploded[21],
it found reason to repent that it had neglected to cultivate[22] the
productive powers of its own country.

These causes, combined[23] with the change[24] of route to India, led
to the gradual decline of this famous confederation[25]; and at the
last general assembly, held at Lübeck in 1630, the deputies from the
several cities appeared merely to declare their secession[26]. In a
modified form[27], however, the Hanse lingered on[28] till the beginning
of the present century—the[29] shadow of a great name. The Free Cities
of Lübeck, Hamburg, Bremen, and Frankfort-on-the-Maine, are now only
nominally the representatives of the Hanse.—J. H. FYFE.

COMING TO TERMS[1].


One of the most distinguished artists in Paris[2] painted for a lady
occupying a brilliant position in society her portrait[3], with[4] the
intention of placing it in an exhibition afterwards. The lady, although
a long time celebrated for her beauty[5], had arrived at that age[6]
which is seldom admitted (fifty years), but[7] endeavoured to conceal it
through cosmetics, and showed herself as beautiful and captivating as in
her younger days [= years]. Paris is full of resources, and ointments are
to be obtained there[8] to heal the wounds of time.

Our heroine had her portrait taken[9] in the most graceful attitude;
splendidly dressed, and leaning on an arm-chair, she looked smiling into
the glass, which should return[10] her the most amiable compliments. The
painter made[11] a most striking likeness, but this was a great mistake—a
flattering one was expected[12], _and the lady_ subsequently[13] declared
that she did not recognise herself (App. § 28) in this painting, and the
portrait was left on the painter’s hands[14]. The artist, feeling himself
hurt in his pride, was too good a philosopher to keep a portrait worth
three thousand francs quietly on his hands[15], and an idea of vengeance
presented itself to his mind[16], which he put into execution at once.

_A_ short time before the day fixed for[17] the opening of the
art-exhibition at the Louvre[18], the lady was secretly informed that
her portrait was ornamented with certain accessories rather compromising
her[19]. She went immediately to the artist. There was the portrait! It
was the same striking likeness certainly; but the painter had thinned the
hair, and the lady so faithfully painted[20] held in her hand two large
tresses of false hair. On the toilet table were several small bottles,
labelled thus[21]: “White-Wash,” “Vegetable Red,” “Cosmetic[22], to
efface wrinkles,” “Lotion, to dye the hair in a minute[23].”

“It is abominable,” said the lady, greatly excited.

“Of what do you complain?” coolly replied the artist. “Did you not
declare (S. 48, N. 2, and App. § 28) that it was not your portrait? You
are right, it is a mere fancy sketch[24], and as such I shall send it to
the exhibition.”

“What, Sir, do you intend to exhibit this painting?”

“Certainly[25], Madam; but as _a_ cabinet picture[26], since the
catalogue will indicate it under the title _of_ ‘The Coquette of Fifty
Years.’”

At this the lady fainted, but soon recovered, and then paid at once for
the portrait[27]. The accessories were effaced[28] in her presence, the
portrait was restored to its original state, and the three thousand
francs were transferred[29] to the purse of the painter.—THE YOUNG

FALSE PRIDE.


Have pity on[1] the youth who is ashamed to be seen carrying[2] a parcel.
Such a youth will never climb the hill[3]; he will never be honoured and
respected by sensible, respectable[4] men. And yet how many there are (S.
82, N. 7) who have the failing[5]. Do you know the story of the young
man who came _down_ from a country town of New Hampshire, and entered
the great wholesale establishment of the Lawrences—Abbot and Amos—in
Boston[6]? He was a young merchant who had just commenced business[7]. He
had money enough _with which_ to purchase a certain quantity _of_ goods,
and wished to get as many more on credit[8], if they (S. 134, N. 4) would
trust[9] him.

Mr. Lawrence shook his head. The young man could offer no security, and
the old[10] merchants did not consider it good _policy_ to give credit
to an unknown and untried young man. The youthful customer did not
blame them. He said he should probably do the same himself by one whom
he did not know[11]. “However,” he added, “I hope I may grow into your
confidence one of these days[12].”

Then he paid _for_ the goods he had purchased; and when they had been
done up[13], he was asked where he would have them sent[14]. “I will
take[15] them myself,” was the answer. “But the parcel is heavy,” said
the clerk. “And I am young and strong,” answered the customer. “No, I
will take the parcel on my shoulder. I cannot earn half a dollar more
easily or more honestly.” And he had taken the parcel on his shoulder,
and had approached the door, when Mr. Lawrence came out of his office,
where[16] he had been a spectator of the scene, and called the youth
back. “You can have all _the_ goods you want, young man[17],” he said.
“Make your own selection, and set your own time for payment[18]. He who
is willing to help himself, will not betray[19] those who are willing to
help him.”

And the old merchant was not mistaken. That young man became one of his
most valuable customers, and one of his valued[20] friends.

When Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte, son of (S. 25, N. 5) King Jerome of
Westphalia and nephew of the Emperor Napoleon I., was a student of[21]
Harvard College, in Cambridgeshire, he was one day carrying a bundle of
clothing[22] from his washer-woman’s to his dormitory[23], when he was
met by a companion[24], who asked him, with much surprise, why he had not
had the bundle sent to his room.

“Why should I do that?” asked the prince. “Why[25],” said his companion
with a little touch of embarrassment, “you know it doesn’t look well to
carry one’s own bundle like a common labourer.”

“Bah[26],” cried Jerome, laughing, “I trust I shall never be ashamed
to be seen bearing[27] anything (S. 3, N. 7) that belongs to a
Bonaparte!”—THE NEW YORK HERALD.

ANECDOTES OF[1] GREAT STATESMEN.


I.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN[2].

The night previous to the meeting of the Convocation[3] of Chicago,
Mr. Lincoln did not get home until[4] eleven o’clock _at night_. In
the morning[5] Mrs. Lincoln, who possessed a most amiable disposition,
remonstrated with her good husband at breakfast. She kindly, but firmly,
informed him[6] that politics[7] were leading him into bad habits,
especially (S. 87, N. 6) to keeping late hours[8] and drinking at the rum
shops. She did not like it; she had to sit up[9], and also the children
were kept awake[10]. “And now, Abraham,” she continued, “let me tell
you[11] that to-night I will go to bed at ten o’clock. If you come before
that hour, well and good[12]; if not[13], I will not get up and let you
in[14].” Ten o’clock came that night, and true to her word, Mrs. Lincoln
went to bed with her children[15]. About an hour later Mr. Lincoln
knocked at[16] the door. He knocked once, twice, and even three times
before[17] an upper window was raised and the nightcap of a female looked
out. “Who is there?” “I.” “You know what I told you, Abraham?” “Yes, but,
wife, I have _got_ something very particular to tell you. Let me in!”
“I don’t want to hear. It is political stuff[18].” “Wife, it is very
important. There is[19] a telegraphic despatch, and I have been nominated
for the Presidency[20].” “Oh, Abraham, this is awful! Now I know you have
been drinking. I only suspected it before, and you may just go and sleep
where you got your liquor[21]!” And down went the window with a slam[22].
The next day confirmed the truth of the news that the humble husband had
been nominated to rule[23] over millions.—THE NEW YORK HERALD.


II.

PRINCE BISMARCK (S. 138, N. 12) AND LORD BEACONSFIELD[24].

Amongst a number of amusing anecdotes of Lord Beaconsfield is one of[25]
the State banquet given at Berlin at the time of the Congress, when[26]
he sat next to Prince Bismarck and opposite to the crown Princess of
Germany. Near to him was a trophy of “bonbons,” on the papers of which
were[27] miniature photographs of the German Emperor and other members
of the Prussian royal family. After the feast was over[28], the lord was
busily engaged (S. 87, N. 6) in securing[29] some of these sweets to take
home as a [+zum+] remembrance of the occasion[30], when Prince Bismarck
suddenly caught him by the arm and so startled him that he dropped his
spoil and exclaimed: “I see, not only does Prince Bismarck give nothing
away, but (S. 6, N. 10) he does not allow anybody to help himself.” The
German Chancellor, on discovering (S. 55, N. 1) that he had interrupted
Lord Beaconsfield in a feat of annexation[31], burst into a hearty laugh,
and retorted: “It is true that[32] I give nothing away; but, as you see,
I am always ready for an honest alliance.” So saying, he turned to the
table and executed an energetic raid upon[33] the “bonbons,” part of
which he handed over to his British colleague.—THE CORRESPONDENT OF “THE
LONDON DAILY TELEGRAPH.”

sich durch beharrliches Selbststudium zum gewandten Advokaten, tüchtigen
Redner und einflußreichen Politiker heranzubilden. Er wurde Abgeordneter
für die Legislatur des Staates Illinois, Mitglied des Kongresses und
des Senats, und ward endlich im Jahre 1860, gerade in dem kritischen
Augenblicke, wo die Südstaaten, welche die Ausdehnung der Sklaverei
forderten, sich wegen Verweigerung dieser Forderung von der Union
lossagten, von den Republikanern zum Präsidenten der Vereinigten Staaten
gewählt. Gleich nach seiner Wahl zur Führung des Staatsruders erfolgte
der Ausbruch jenes stets denkwürdigen Bürgerkrieges seitens der Union und
der sich empörenden Südstaaten, welcher fünf Jahre lang mit mörderischer
Wut das Land zerrüttete und endlich mit der gänzlichen Abschaffung der
Sklaverei und der Besiegung der Südstaaten endete. Kaum war er jedoch
im März 1865 zum zweiten Male durch ungeheure Stimmenmehrheit von der
Union zum Präsidenten erwählt worden, und kaum waren die Streitkräfte
der Südstaaten auf immer gebrochen und vernichtet, als der gefeierte
Staatsmann am 14. April 1865 bei Gelegenheit einer Theatervorstellung
im Ford’schen Theater zu Washington der ruchlosen Hand eines von der
demokratischen Partei angereizten Mörders, des Schauspielers John Wilkes

THE POWER OF MUSIC.


On one occasion when young Chopin[1] had been travelling for several
days in the slow _fashion of_ German diligences, he was delighted and
surprised, on stopping at a small post-house, to discover a grand
pianoforte in one of the rooms[2], and still more surprised to find it
in tune[3]—thanks, probably, to the musical taste of the postmaster’s
family. He sat down instantly and began to improvise in[4] his peculiarly
happy manner. One by one the travellers were attracted by the unwonted
sweet sounds. One of them even allowed[5] his beloved pipe to go out in
his ecstasy, and the postmaster, his wife, and his two daughters joined
the group of listeners. Unmindful of his audience, of the journey,
the lapse of time[6], and everything but the music, Chopin continued
to play, and his companions[7] to listen in rapt attention, when they
were suddenly roused by a stentorian[8] voice, which made the windows
rattle, calling out[9]: “The horses are ready, gentlemen!” The postmaster
roared out an anathema[10] against the disturber—the postillion—and the
passengers cast angry glances at him. Chopin started from his seat, but
was instantly surrounded by his audience, who entreated him to continue.
“But we have been here for some time,” said Chopin, consulting his watch,
“and are due in Posen already[11].” “Stay and play, noble young artist,”
cried the postmaster, “I will find you courier’s horses if you will only
remain a little longer.” “Do be persuaded[12],” added the postmaster’s
wife, almost threatening the artist with an embrace[13]. What could
he do but resume his place at the instrument? When at last he paused,
the servant appeared with wine; the host’s daughter served the artist
first, and then the travellers, upon which the postmaster proposed a
cheer for[14] the musician, in which all joined[15]. The ladies in their
gratitude filled the carriage pockets with the best eatables and wine
the house contained; and when at last the artist rose to go[16], his
gigantic host seized him in his arms and triumphantly bore him to[17]
the carriage! Long[18] years afterwards Chopin would recall (S. 101, N.
22) this little incident with pleasure, and declare that the plaudits of
the press had never given him more delight than the homage[19] of these
simple music-loving Germans.—MANCHESTER TIT-BITS.

THE TWO SCHOOLBOYS, OR EYES AND NO EYES[1].

I.


“Well, Robert, where have you been walking[2] this afternoon?” said a
tutor to one of his pupils, at the close[3] of a holiday.

ROBERT.—I have been to Millthorp-Heath, and so round by[4] the windmill
upon Camp-Mount, and home through the meadows by the river side.

TUTOR.—Well, that is a pleasant round[5].

ROBERT.—I thought[6] it very dull, sir; I scarcely met with a single
person. I would much rather have gone[7] along the turnpike-road.

TUTOR.—To be sure, if seeing men and horses is your object[8], you are,
indeed, better entertained on the high-road. But did you not see William
(S. 48, N. 2)?

ROBERT.—We set out together[9]; but he lagged behind in the lane, and
so[10] I walked on and left him.

TUTOR.—That was a pity. He would have been company for you.

ROBERT.—Oh, he is so tedious, always stopping to look at this thing or
that! I would rather walk alone[11]. I dare say he is not come yet.

TUTOR.—Here he comes. Well, William, where have you been?

WILLIAM.—Oh, the pleasantest walk[12]! I went all over Millthorp-Heath,
and so up to the mill at the top of the hill, and then down among the
green meadows by the side of the river home again.

TUTOR.—Why, that is just the round Robert has been taking, and he
complains of _its_ dulness and prefers the high-road.

WILLIAM.—I wonder at that. I am sure I hardly took a step that did
not delight me; and I have brought home my handkerchief full of
curiosities[13].

TUTOR.—Suppose[14], then, you give us an account of what amused you so
much. I fancy it will[15] be as new to Robert as to me.

WILLIAM.—I will do it readily. The lane leading to the heath, you know,
is close[16] and sandy, so I did not mind it much, but made the best of
my way[17]. However, I spied a curious thing enough[18] in the hedge. It
was an old crab-tree, out of which grew a bunch of something green[19],
quite different from the tree itself. Here is a branch of it.

TUTOR.—Ah! this is mistletoe, a plant of great fame[20] for the use
made of it by the Druids of old[21], in their religious rites and
incantations. It bears[22] a very slimy, white berry, of which bird-lime
may be made, whence[23] its Latin name “viscum.” It is one of those
plants which do not grow in the ground by a root of their own[24],
but fix themselves upon other plants; whence[25] they have been
humourously[26] styled “parasitical,” as being hangers on, or dependents.
It was the mistletoe of the oak that the Druids particularly honoured.

WILLIAM.—A little further on I saw a green woodpecker[1] fly to a tree,
and run up the trunk like a cat.

TUTOR.—That was[2] to seek _for_ insects which live in the bark of trees.
For that purpose the woodpeckers bore holes into the bark with their
strong bills, whereby they do[3] a great deal of damage to the trees.

WILLIAM.—What beautiful birds they are[4]!

TUTOR.—Yes; the woodpecker has, from its colour and size, been called the
English parrot (S. 4, N. 4, +man+).

WILLIAM.—When I got upon the heath, how charming it was[5]! The air
was so fresh, and the prospect on every side[6] so free and unbounded!
The heath was all covered with gay flowers, many of which I had never
observed before. There were[7] at least three different kinds (S. 36,
N. 7, _A_) of heath (I have them in my handkerchief here) and gorse, and
broom, and bell-flowers; and many others of all colours, of which I will
beg you presently to tell me the names[8].

TUTOR.—That I will do readily.

WILLIAM.—I saw, too, several birds that were new to me. There was a
pretty grayish one, of the size of a lark, that was hopping about some
great stones; and when he flew he showed a great deal of white above his
tail[9].

TUTOR.—That was a wheat-ear[10]. They are reckoned very delicious birds
to eat[11], and frequent the _open_ downs in[12] Sussex, and some other
counties, in great number.

WILLIAM.—There was a flock of lapwings upon a marshy part of the
heath[13] that amused me much. As I came near them, some of them kept
flying round and round[14], just over my head, and crying, “Pewit,”
“Pewit,” so distinctly, one might almost fancy they spoke[15]. I thought
I should have caught[16] one of them, for he flew as if one of his wings
was broken (App. § 33), and often tumbled close to the ground; but as I
came near, he always contrived[17] to get away.

TUTOR.—Ha, ha! you were finely taken in, then[18]! This was all an
artifice of the bird’s, to entice you away from its nest, for the
lapwings build upon the bare ground, and their nests would easily be
observed, did they not draw off[19] the attention of intruders, by their
loud cries and counterfeit lameness.

WILLIAM.—I wish I had known that[20], for the bird led me a long
chase[21], often over shoes in water. However, this was the cause
[+davon+, S. 161, N. 21] of my falling in with[22] an old man and a boy,
who were cutting[23] and piling up turf for fuel. I had a great deal of
talk with them about the manner of preparing the turf, and the price it
sells at[24]. They gave me, too, a creature I never saw before—a young
viper, which they had just killed. I have seen several common snakes, but

TUTOR.—True. Vipers frequent[1] those turfy, boggy grounds[2] pretty
much, and I have known several turf-cutters bitten by them.

WILLIAM.—They are very venomous, are they not?

TUTOR.—Enough so[3] to make their wounds painful and dangerous, though
they seldom prove fatal.

WILLIAM.—Well, I then took my course[4] up to the windmill on the mount.
I climbed up the steps of the mill, in order to get a better view of the
country round[5]. What an extensive prospect! I counted fifteen church
steeples; I saw several gentlemen’s houses[6] peeping out from the midst
of green woods and plantations[7]; and I could trace the windings[8] of
the river all along the low grounds, till it was lost behind a ridge of
hills[9]. But I will tell you what I mean to do[10], if you will give me
leave.

TUTOR.—What is that[11]?

WILLIAM.—I will go again and take with me Carey’s county map[12], by
which I shall probably be able to make out most of the places.

TUTOR.—You shall have it; and I will go with you, and take my pocket
spying-glass.

WILLIAM.—I shall be very glad of that. Well, a thought struck me, that,
as the hill is called Camp-Mount, there might probably be some remains of
ditches and mounds[13] with which I have read that camps were surrounded.
And I really believe I discovered something of that sort[14] running one
side of the mount.

TUTOR.—Very likely you might[15]. I know antiquaries have described
such remains as existing there, which some suppose to be Roman, others
Danish[16]. We will examine them when we go.

WILLIAM.—From the hill I went straight down to the meadows below, and
walked on the side of a brook that runs[17] into the river. It[18]
was all bordered with reeds and tall flowering-plants (S. 16, N. 10),
quite different from those I had seen on the heath. As I was getting
down[19] the bank to reach one of them, I heard something plunge into
the water near me. It was a large water-rat, and I saw it swim over to
the other side, and go[20] into its hole. There were[21] a great many
large dragon-flies all about the stream. I caught one of the finest, and
have him here in a leaf. But how I longed to catch a bird that I saw
hovering[22] over the water, and every now and then darting into it! It
was all over a mixture of the most beautiful green and blue, with some
orange colour[23]. It was somewhat less than a thrush, and had a large
head and bill, and a short tail.

THE TWO SCHOOLBOYS, OR EYES AND NO EYES.

IV.


TUTOR.—I can tell you what that bird was—a kingfisher, the celebrated
halcyon of the ancients, about which so many tales are told. It lives
on[1] fish, which it catches in the manner you saw. It builds in holes on
the banks, and is a shy, retired[2] bird, never to be seen far from the
stream it inhabits.

WILLIAM.—I must try to get another sight of him, for I never saw (S. 48,
N. 2) a bird that pleased me so much. Well, I followed this little brook
till it entered[3] the river, and then took[4] the path that runs along
the bank. On the opposite side, I observed several little birds running
along the bank, and making a piping noise[5]. They were[6] brown and
white, and about as big as a snipe.

TUTOR.—I suppose they [+es+] were sand-pipers[7]; one of the numerous
family of birds (S. 36, N. 7, _A_) that get their living[8] by wading
among the shallows and picking up worms and insects.

WILLIAM.—There were a great many swallows, too, sporting[9] above
the surface of the water, that entertained me with their motions.
Sometimes[10] they dashed down into the stream[11]; sometimes they
pursued one another so quickly, that the eye could scarcely follow
them. In one place, where a steep sand-bank rose high above the river,
I observed many of them go in and out of holes with which the bank was
bored full[12].

TUTOR.—Those [+Das+] were sand-martins[13], the smallest of our species
of swallows. They are of a mouse-colour above, and white beneath.
They[14] make their nests, and bring up their young, in these holes,
which run a great depth, and by their situation are secure from all
plunderers.

WILLIAM.—A little further I saw a man in a boat, who was catching eels in
an odd way[15]. He had a long pole with broad iron prongs[16] at the end;
just like Neptune’s trident[17], only there were five prongs instead of
three. This he pushed straight down into the mud, in the deepest parts of
the river, and fetched up the eels sticking between the prongs.

TUTOR.—I know the method. It is called the spearing of eels[18].

WILLIAM.—While I was looking at him, a heron came flying over my head,
with his large flagging wings. He alighted[19] at the next turn of the
river, and I crept softly behind the bank to watch his motions. He had
waded into the water as far as his long legs would allow him[20] and was
standing there motionless with his neck drawn in, looking[21] intently
on the stream. Presently he darted his long bill as quick as lightning
into the water, and drew out a fish, which he swallowed. I saw him catch
another in the same manner. He then took alarm[22] at some noise I made,
and flew away slowly to a wood at some distance, where he settled.

TUTOR.—Probably his nest was there, for herons build upon the loftiest
tree they can find, and sometimes in society together, like rooks.
Formerly, when these birds were valued for the amusement of hawking[1],
many gentlemen had their heronries[2], and a few are still remaining.

WILLIAM.—I think (S. 64, N. 11) they are the largest wild birds we have.

TUTOR.—They are of great length and spread of wing[3], but their bodies
are comparatively small.

WILLIAM.—I then turned homeward, across the meadows, where I stopped
awhile, to look at[4] a large flock of starlings, which kept flying about
at no great distance. I could not tell at first what to make of them[5],
for they rose altogether from the ground as thick as a swarm of bees,
and formed _themselves into_ a kind[6] of black cloud, hovering over the
field. After taking a short round[7], they settled again, but presently
rose in the same manner. I dare say[8] there were hundreds of them.

TUTOR.—Perhaps so[9]; for in the fenny counties their flocks are so
numerous[10] as to break down whole acres of reeds, by settling on
them[11]. This disposition[12] of starlings to fly in close swarms
was remarked even by Homer, who compares the foe (S. 48, N. 6) flying
from one of his heroes to a cloud of starlings retiring dismayed at the
approach of the hawk.

WILLIAM.—After I had left the meadows, I crossed[13] the corn-fields
in the way to our house, and passed close by a deep marl-pit. Looking
into it, I saw, on one of the sides, a cluster of what[14] I took to be
shells; and upon going down, I picked up a clod of marl[15], which was
quite full of them; but how sea-shells can get there, I cannot imagine.

TUTOR.—I do not wonder at your surprise, since many philosophers have
been much perplexed to account for the same appearance[16]. It is not
uncommon to find[17] great quantities of shells and relics of marine
animals, even in the bowels of high mountains, very remote from the sea.

WILLIAM.—I got[18] to the high field next to our house just as the sun
was setting, and I stood looking at it till it was quite lost[19]. What a
glorious sight! The clouds were tinged with purple, crimson, and yellow
of all shades and hues, and the clear sky varied from blue to a fine
green at the horizon. But how large the sun appears just as it sets! I
think it seems twice as big as when it is over-head.

TUTOR.—It does so[1]; and you _may_ probably have observed the same
apparent enlargement of the moon at its rising[2].

WILLIAM.—I have[3]; but pray what is the reason of this?

TUTOR.—It is an optical deception, depending upon principles which I
cannot well explain to you, till you know more of that _branch of_
science. But what a number of new ideas this afternoon’s walk has
afforded you. I do not wonder that you found it amusing[4], and it has
been very instructive too. Did you see (S. 48, N. 2) nothing of all these
sights, Robert?

ROBERT.—I saw some of them, but I did not take particular notice of them.

TUTOR.—Why not?

ROBERT.—I do not know. I did not care about them; and I made the best of
my way home[5].

TUTOR.—That would have been (App. § 33) right, if you had been sent on
a message[6]; but as you only walked for amusement[7], it would have
been wiser to have sought out as many sources of it as possible[8]. But
as it is[9]: one man walks through the world with the eyes open, and
another with them shut, and[10] upon this difference depends all the[11]
superiority the one acquires above the other. I have known sailors[12]
who have been in all the quarters of the world, and could tell you
nothing but[13] the signs of the tippling houses they frequented[14] in
different ports, and the price and quality of the liquor. On the other
hand[15], a Franklin could not even cross the Channel without making
some observation useful to mankind[16]. While many a vacant, thoughtless
youth is whirled throughout Europe[17], without gaining[18] a single idea
worth crossing a street for[19], the observing eye and inquiring mind
find matter of improvement and delight[20] in every ramble _in town or

THE KING AND THE MILLER.

I.


In the reign[1] of Frederick the Great (see S. 192, N. 1), king of
Prussia, there was[2] a mill near Potsdam which obstructed the view from
the windows of the palace of Sans Souci. Annoyed by this drawback to
his favourite residence[3], the king sent[4] to the owner of the mill
inquiring the price for which he would sell it. “For no price,” was the
reply of the sturdy Prussian; and in a moment of anger the monarch gave
orders[5] that the mill should be pulled down. “The king may do this,”
said the miller, quietly folding his arms; “but there are (S. 82, N. 7)
laws in Prussia, and he will find them out[6]”. Forthwith he commenced a
law-suit against the monarch, the issue of which was[7], that the court
gave a decision against His Majesty, compelling him[8] to rebuild the
mill, and in addition[9] to pay a large sum of money as a compensation
for the injury he had done[10]. The king felt mortified (S. 87, N. 6)
at having been worsted by one of his subjects, but had the magnanimity
to say, addressing[11] his courtiers: “I am glad to find that there are
just laws and upright judges in my kingdom who are bold enough to decide
against me when they think I am in the wrong.” Many years afterwards
(App. § 14), a descendant of the honest miller, who had in _due_ course
of time succeeded to the hereditary possession of the property[12], found
himself involved in pecuniary difficulties that had become insurmountable.

II.


In his distress he wrote to Frederick William IV, who was at that time
king of Prussia, reminding him of the refusal experienced by Frederick
the Great at the hands[1] of his ancestor the miller, and stating[2]
that[3] if His Majesty now wished to obtain possession of the property,
he would, in his present embarrassed circumstances, most willingly
dispose of the mill. The king immediately wrote, with his own hand[4],
_the_ following reply:

    “My Dear Neighbour,

    I cannot allow you to sell the mill. It must remain in the
    possession of your family as long as one of your descendants
    survives[5], for the building belongs[6] to the history of
    Prussia, and is a standing[7] memorial of the integrity of our
    judges and the impartiality of our laws. I am sorry, however,
    to hear that you are in straitened circumstances, and therefore
    send you six thousand dollars[8] to pay off your debts, and
    hope the sum will be sufficient for the purpose. Consider me[9]
    always

                    Your affectionate[10] neighbour,

                                                 FREDERICK WILLIAM.”

The mill still stands, and is occupied by the[11] descendants of the

One wet wintry night, when a gentleman was hurrying along[1] one of
the crowded thoroughfares of London, his attention was arrested by a
lean, hungry-looking dog which rushed past him. He observed that it
had a collar[2] round its neck, to which a basket was attached. If it
was (App. § 36) a dog that ran on errands[3], he thought that surely
its owner would feed it better, and its ribs would not look so spare.
Thinking that there was some mystery connected with the animal[4], he
resolved to follow it[5]. After a[6] time it turned up a narrow lane into
a stable-yard, where some coachmen and hostlers were loitering about.
It then got up on its hind-legs, and began walking about in circles[7].
The bystanders, surprised at this strange proceeding, formed round in a
ring and looked on. It walked five times round, standing[8] erect, and
looking fixedly before it like a soldier on duty[9], evidently doing its
utmost[10] to make the company laugh. After taking a short rest, it began
its performance[11] again, but this time on its fore-feet, pretending to
stand[12] on its (S. 43, N. 9) head. Tiring of this[13], it lay down in
the middle of the ring, feigning to be dead[14], and going through all
the convulsions of a dying dog, breathing heavily, panting, suffering
the lower jaw to fall[15], and then turning over motionless. It did this
so well, that a woman in the crowd exclaimed: “Poor beast!” and drew
her hand across her eyes[16]. Having lain still a minute, with its eyes
closed, it got up and shook itself, to show that the performance[17] was
over. It then went round begging on its hind-legs, standing[18] a little
while before each of the spectators, and earnestly watching[19] to see
whether they put their hands into their pockets or not. The basket round
its neck had a slit in the lid, into which the coppers might be dropped.

A FRIEND IN NEED.

II.


The gentleman put in a shilling, and stooped down to read a crumpled
piece of paper which hung loosely from the collar. It bore these words,
written in a[1] shaky hand: “This is the dog of a poor man who is
bed-ridden. It earns bread for its master. Good people, do not prevent
it from returning to its home.” On receiving (S. 55, N. 1) _any_ money,
the poor creature returned thanks by a wag of its tail. Almost every
one of the spectators gave the dog something, and when it had finished
collecting the money, it barked once or twice, as if to say good-bye,
and then scampered off. On entering the principal street, it quickened
its pace[2], and the gentleman finding it impossible to keep up with
it[3], hailed[4] a cab, and, much to the driver’s amazement[5], cried:
“Follow that dog.” After a time the dog bolted up a narrow alley[6],
through which the cab could not pass[7]. The gentleman alighted, and
followed the dog through a dark close up[8] to the garret of a rickety
dwelling. Pulling the string attached to the latch, the dog opened the
door, and the stranger followed. Its master lay dying[9] on a wretched
bed, supported[10] by the earnings of the faithful creature, who
practised[11] the same tricks alone as it used to do under its master’s
superintendence. Death soon ended[12] the poor man’s sufferings, and the
dog followed the coffin to the grave. The gentleman took home the dog,
but next morning the poor beast howled impatiently for[13] the basket to
go its rounds as usual. It went with the pennies to the cemetery and laid
them on a grave, whining[14] mournfully, and trying to scratch up the
earth. Twice more it went out all day, and brought back the money for its
master; but, on finding the money untouched, it lay down at full length
upon the grave. The next morning it did not go its rounds, for it was
dead.—CHAMBERS’S “SHORT STORIES.”

MY FIRST GUINEA.


I well remember[1], when I was very young, possessing for the first
time a guinea. I remember too that this circumstance cost me no little
perplexity and anxiety. As I passed along the streets, the fear of
losing my guinea induced me oftentimes to take it out of my pocket to
look at it. First I put[2] it in one pocket, then I took it out and put
it in another; after a while I took it out of the second pocket and
placed[2] it in another, really perplexed[3] what to do with it (S. 27,
N. 7).

At last my attention was arrested by a book-auction. I stepped in and
looked about me. First one lot[4] was put up, and then another, and sold
to the highest bidder[5]. At last I ventured to the table, just as the
auctioneer was putting up “The History of the World,” in two large folio
volumes. I instantly thrust[2] my hand into my (S. 43, N. 9) pocket,
and began turning over[6] my guinea, considering whether I should have
money enough to buy this lot. The bidding proceeded[7], and at last
I ventured to bid too. “Halloo! my little man!” said the auctioneer,
“what! (S. 27, N. 7) not content with less than the world?” This remark
greatly confused me, and drew the attention of the whole company[8]
toward me, who[9], seeing (S. 30, N. 4) me anxious[10] to possess the
books, refrained from bidding against me; and so, “The World” was knocked
down[11] to me at a very moderate price.

How to get[12] these huge books home was the next consideration[13].
The auctioneer offered to send them, but I, not knowing what sort of
creatures auctioneers were[14], determined to take them myself; so,
after[15] the assistant had tied them up, I marched out of the room with
these huge books upon my shoulder, like Samson with the gates of Gaza,
amid the smiles of all present.

When I reached my home, after the servant had opened the door, the first
person I met was my sainted mother.

“My dear boy,” she said, “what have you _got_ there? I thought you would
not keep your guinea long.”

“Do not be angry, mother,” said I, throwing the books down upon the
table. “I have bought ‘The World’ for nine shillings.”

This was on a Saturday, and I well remember sitting up[16] till it was
well-nigh midnight, turning over[17] this “History of the World.” The
books became my delight, and were carefully read through and through.

When I grew older, I became at length a Christian, and my love of
books[18], among other things, led me to desire to be a Christian
minister[19]. To the possession of these books I attribute, in a great
measure, any honours that have been added to my name in connection
with literature. I have not mentioned this anecdote to gratify any
foolish feeling[20], but to encourage in all whom I see before me
that[21] love of literature which has afforded me such unspeakable
pleasure—pleasure[22] which I would not have been without for all the
riches of the Indies[23].—THE REV. DR. VAUGHAN.

THE GREEN VAULTS IN DRESDEN.


                                                    Dresden, May 11, 1845.

We were fortunate in seeing the Green Vaults or “Das grüne Gewölbe,” a
collection of jewels and costly articles[1], unsurpassed in Europe (S.
7, N. 3, _A_). Admittance is only granted to six persons at a time, who
pay a fee[2] of two thalers. The customary way is to employ a “valet
de place[3],” who goes round from one hotel to another, until he has
collected the required number, when[4] he brings them together and
conducts them to the keeper who has charge of the treasures. The first
hall into which we were ushered contained works in bronze[5]. They were
all small, and chosen with regard to their artistical value. The next
room contained statues, and vases ornamented with reliefs, in ivory. The
most remarkable work was the fall of Lucifer and his angels, containing
ninety-two figures in all[6], carved out of a single piece _of_ ivory
sixteen inches high! It was the work of an Italian monk, and cost him
many years of hard labour[7].

However costly the contents of these halls (S. 27, N. 7), they were only
an introduction to those which followed. Each one exceeded the other in
splendour and costliness. The walls were covered to the ceiling with rows
of goblets, vases, etc., of polished jasper, agate, and lapis lazuli. We
saw two goblets, each prized at six thousand thalers, made of gold and
precious stones; also the great pearl called the Spanish Dwarf, nearly
as large as a pullet’s egg; globes and vases cut entirely out of _the_
mountain crystal; magnificent Nuremberg watches and clocks, and a great
number of figures made ingeniously of rough[8] pearls and diamonds.
The seventh hall contains the coronation robes of Augustus II, king of
Poland, and many costly specimens of carving in wood[9]. A cherry-stone
is shown in a glass case, which has one hundred and twenty-five faces,
all perfectly finished, carved upon it[10]. The next room we entered sent
back a glare of splendour[11] that perfectly dazzled us. It was all gold,
diamond, ruby, and sapphire. Every case sent out a glow and a glitter
that it seemed like a cage of imprisoned lightnings[12]. Wherever the
eye turned it was met by a blaze of broken rainbows. They were there by
hundreds[13], and every gem was a fortune. We here saw the largest known
onyx, nearly seven inches long, and four inches broad! One of the most
remarkable works is the throne and court of Aurungzebe, the Indian king,
by Dinglinger, a celebrated goldsmith of the last century. It contains
one hundred and thirty-two figures, all of enamelled gold, and each
one most perfectly and elaborately finished. It was purchased by Prince
Augustus for fifty-eight thousand thalers, which was not an exorbitant
sum, considering that the making of it occupied Dinglinger and thirteen
workmen for seven years!

It is almost impossible to estimate the value of the treasures these
halls contain. That of gold and jewels alone must be many millions of
dollars, and the amount of labour expended on these toys of royalty is
incredible.—BAYARD TAYLOR, “VIEWS AFOOT.”

THE DEATH OF LITTLE NELL.


She was dead. No sleep (S. 27, N. 7) so beautiful and calm, so free from
trace[1] of pain, so fair to look upon. She seemed[2] a creature fresh
from the hand of God, and waiting for the breath of life; not one who had
lived and suffered death. Her couch was dressed with here and there some
winterberries and green leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to
favour. “When I die, put near me something[3] that has loved the light,
and had the sky above it always.” These were her words.

She was dead. Dear (S. 10, N. 2), gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead.
Her little bird—a poor, slight thing[4], the pressure of the finger would
have crushed—was stirring nimbly in its cage; and the strong heart of
its child-mistress[5] was mute and motionless for ever! Where were the
traces of her early cares, her sufferings and fatigues? All gone[6].
Sorrow was dead, _indeed_ in her[7]; but peace and perfect happiness were
born—imaged in her tranquil beauty and (S. 10, N. 9) profound repose.

And still her former self lay there, unaltered in this change[8]. Yes,
the old fireside[9] had smiled upon that same sweet face; it had passed
like a dream through haunts of misery and care—at the door of the poor
schoolmaster on the summer evening, before the furnace-fire upon the cold
wet night, at the still bedside of the dying boy[10], there had been the
same mild and loving look. So shall we know the angels in their majesty
after death.—CHARLES DICKENS, “THE OLD CURIOSITY SHOP.”

THE CHILDHOOD OF ROBERT CLIVE[1].


Some lineaments of the character of the man were early discerned in the
child. There remain[2] letters written by his relations when he was in
his seventh year; and from[3] these letters it appears that, even at
that early age, his strong will and his fiery passions, sustained by a
constitutional intrepidity[4], had begun to cause great uneasiness to
his family. “Fighting,” says one of his uncles, “to which he is out of
measure addicted, gives his temper such a fierceness and imperiousness,
that he flies out on every occasion[5].” The old people of the
neighbourhood still remember to have heard from their parents how Bob
Clive climbed to the top of the lofty steeple of Market Drayton, and
with what terror the inhabitants saw (S. 78, N. 14, _B_) him seated on
a stone spout near the summit. They also relate how he formed all the
idle lads of the town into a kind of predatory army[6], and compelled
the shop-keepers to submit to a tribute of apples and halfpence, in
consideration of which[7] he guaranteed the security of their windows.
He was sent from school to school, making very little progress in his
learning[8], and gaining for himself everywhere the character of an
exceedingly naughty boy. One of his masters, it is said, was sagacious
enough to prophesy that the idle lad would make a great figure in the
world[9].—LORD MACAULAY, “LORD CLIVE.”

AN ADVENTURE WITH A LION.

I.


It is well[1] known that if one of a troop of lions is killed, the
others take the hint[2], and leave that part of the country. So[3] the
next time the herds were attacked, I went with the people, in order to
encourage them to rid themselves of the annoyance by destroying[4] one
of the marauders. We found the lions on a small hill about a quarter of
a mile in length[5], which was covered with trees. A circle of men was
formed round it, and they gradually closed up[6], ascending pretty near
to each other. Being down below on the plain with a native schoolmaster,
named Mebalwe, a most excellent man (S. 53, N. 9), I saw one of the
lions sitting (S. 78, N. 14, _B_) on a _piece of_ rock within the
now-closed circle _of men_. Mebalwe fired at him before I could[7], and
the ball struck the rock on which the animal was sitting. He bit at
the spot struck, as a dog does at a stick or stone thrown at him; then
leaping away[8], broke through the opening circle, and escaped unhurt.
The men were afraid to attack him on account of their belief in [+an+]
witchcraft. When the circle was re-formed, we saw two other lions in
it; but were afraid[9] to fire lest we should strike the men, and they
allowed the beasts to burst through also. If (App. § 36) the Bakatta had
acted according to the custom of the country, they would have speared the
lions in their attempt to get out. Seeing we could not get[10] them to
kill one of the lions, we bent our footsteps[11] towards the village; in
going round the end of the hill, however, I saw one of the beasts sitting
on a _piece of_ rock as before, but this time he had a little bush in
front. Being about thirty yards[12] off, I took a good aim at his body
through the bush, and fired both barrels into it. The men then called
out: “He is shot! he is shot!” Others cried: “He has been shot by another
man, too; let us go to him!” I did not see any one else shoot at him, but
I saw the lion’s tail[13] erected in anger behind the bush, and turning
to the people, said: “Stop a little till I load[14] again.”

AN ADVENTURE WITH A LION.

II.


When (S. 27, N. 7) in the act[1] of ramming down the bullets, I heard
a shout. Starting, and looking half round, I saw the lion just in the
act of springing[2] upon me. I was upon a little height; he caught my
shoulder as he sprang[3], and we both came to the ground below together.
Growling (S. 55, N. 1, +während+) horribly close to my ear, he shook
me as a terrier dog does a rat. The shock produced a stupor similar to
that which seems to be felt by a mouse after the first shake of the
cat. It caused a sort of dreaminess, in which there was[4] no sense of
pain nor feeling of terror, though I was quite conscious of all that
was happening. It was like what[5] patients, particularly under the
influence of chloroform, describe, who see all the operation, but do not
feel the knife. This singular condition was not the result of any mental
process. The shake annihilated fear, and allowed no sense of horror[6]
in looking round at the beast. This peculiar state is probably produced
in all animals killed by the carnivora[7]; and, if so[8], is a merciful
provision by our benevolent creator for lessening the pain of death (S.
76, N. 22, _B_, 1). Turning round to relieve myself of the weight, as
he had one paw on the back of my head[9], I saw his eyes directed to
Mebalwe, who was trying to shoot him at a distance of ten or fifteen
yards. His gun, a flint one[10], missed fire in both barrels; the lion
immediately left me, and attacking Mebalwe, bit[11] his thigh. Another
man, whose life I had saved before, after he had been tossed[12] by a
buffalo, attempted to spear the lion while he was biting Mebalwe. He
left Mebalwe, and caught this man by the shoulder; but, at that moment,
the bullets he had received took effect[13], and he fell down dead. The
whole was the work of a few moments, and must have been his paroxysm of
dying rage. In order to take out the charm from him, the Bakatta on the
following day made a huge bonfire over his carcass, which was declared
to be that of the largest lion they had ever seen. Besides crunching the
bone into splinters, he left[14] eleven teeth wounds on the upper part of
my arm.—DR. LIVINGSTONE.

THE BURNING OF MOSCOW. (Comp. S. 156, N. 1.)

I.


On the 14th _of_ September, 1812, while the rear-guard of the Russians
were in the act (S. 216, N. 1) of evacuating Moscow, Napoleon reached the
hill called the Mount of Salvation[1], because _it is_ there _where_ the
natives kneel and cross themselves at first sight of the Holy City.

Moscow seemed as lordly and striking[2] as ever, with the steeples of
its thirty churches, and its copper domes glittering in the sun; its
palaces of Eastern architecture mingled with trees, and surrounded with
gardens[3]; and its Kremlin[4], a huge triangular mass of towers,[5]
something between a palace and a castle, which rose like a citadel out
of the general[6] mass of groves and buildings. But not a chimney sent
up smoke[7], not a man appeared on the battlements, or at the gates.
Napoleon gazed[8] every moment expecting to see a train of bearded
boyards arriving to (S. 19, N. 7) fling themselves at his feet, and place
their wealth at his disposal. His first exclamation was: “Behold at last
that celebrated city!” His next: “It was full[9] time!” His army, less
regardful of the past or the future[10], fixed their eyes on the goal of
their wishes, and a shout of “Moscow! Moscow!” passed from rank to rank.

Bonaparte, as if unwilling to encounter the sight of the empty streets,
stopped immediately on entering the first suburb. His troops were
quartered in the desolate city. During the first few hours after their
arrival[11], an obscure rumour, which could not be traced[12], but one of
those which are sometimes found to get abroad before the approach of some
awful certainty[13], announced that the city would be endangered by fire
in the course of the night[14].

_Section 218._

THE BURNING OF MOSCOW.

II.


The report seemed to arise from[1] those evident circumstances which
rendered the event probable, but no one took any notice of it, until[2]
at midnight, _when_ the soldiers were startled from their quarters
by the report that the town was in flames (App. § 28). The memorable
conflagration began amongst[3] the coachmakers’ warehouses and workshops
in the Bazaar, _which was_ the richest district of the city. It was
imputed to accident, and the progress of the flames was subdued by
the exertions of the French soldiers. Napoleon, who had been roused
by the tumult, hurried to the spot[4]; and when the alarm seemed at
an end[5], he retired, not to his former quarters in the suburbs, but
to the Kremlin, the hereditary palace of the only sovereign whom he
had ever treated as an equal[6], and over whom his successful arms had
now attained such an apparently[7] immense superiority. Yet he did not
suffer himself to be dazzled by the advantages he had attained, but
availed himself of the light of the blazing Bazaar, to write to the
Emperor proposals of peace with his own hand[8]. They were despatched by
a Russian officer of rank, who had been disabled by indisposition from
following the army. But no answer was ever returned[9].

Next day the flames had disappeared, and the French officers
luxuriously[10] employed themselves (S. 87, N. 6) in selecting out of the
deserted palaces of Moscow, that which best pleased the fancy of each
for his residence. At night the flames again arose in the north and west
quarters of the city. As the greater part of the houses were built of

This was at first imputed to the blazing brands [= pieces of wood] and
sparkles which were carried by the wind; but at length it was observed,
that, as often as the wind changed[1],—and it changed three times in that
terrible night,—new flames broke always forth in that direction, where[2]
the existing gale was calculated to direct them on[3] the Kremlin. These
horrors were[4] increased by the chance[5] of explosion. There was,
though as yet unknown to the French, a magazine of powder in the Kremlin;
besides that, a park of artillery, with its ammunition, was drawn up[6]
under the Emperor’s window. Morning (S. 3, N. 2) came, and with it a
dreadful scene. During the whole night, the metropolis had glared[7]
with a thick and suffocating atmosphere, of almost palpable smoke. The
flames defied the efforts of the French soldiery, and it is said that the
fountains of the city had been rendered inaccessible, the water-pipes
cut, and the fire-engines destroyed or carried off.

Then came the reports of fire-balls having been found burning in
deserted houses; of men and women, that, like demons, had been seen
openly spreading the flames, and who were said to be[8] furnished with
combustibles for rendering their dreadful work more secure. Several
wretches against[9] whom such acts had been charged, were seized (S. 2,
N. 1) upon, and, probably without much inquiry, _were_ shot on the spot.
While it was almost impossible to keep the roof of the Kremlin free of
the burning brands which the wind showered down[10], Napoleon watched
from the windows the course of the fire which devoured his fair conquest,
and the exclamation burst from him[11]: “These are indeed Scythians!”

THE BURNING OF MOSCOW.

IV.


The equinoctial gales rose higher and higher[1] upon the third night,
and extended the flames, with which there was no longer any human power
of contending[2]. At the dead[3] hour of midnight, the Kremlin itself
was found to be on fire. A soldier of the Russian police, charged with
being incendiary[4], was turned over[5] to the summary[6] vengeance
of the Imperial Guard. Bonaparte was then, at length, persuaded, by
the entreaties of all around him, to relinquish his quarters in the
Kremlin, to which, as the visible mark of his conquest, he had seemed
to cling with the tenacity of a lion holding a fragment of his prey. He
encountered both difficulty and danger in retiring from the palace, and,
before he could gain the city gate, he had to traverse with his suite
streets arched with fire[7], and in which the very air they breathed was
suffocating. At length he gained the open country, and took up his abode
in a palace of the Czar’s called Petrowsky, about a French league from
the city. As he looked back on the fire, which, under the influence of
the autumnal wind, swelled and surged round the Kremlin, like an infernal
ocean around a sable Pandemonium[8], he could not suppress the ominous
expression: “This bodes us great misfortune!”

The fire continued to triumph unopposed, and consumed in a few days
what it had cost centuries to raise. “Palaces and temples,” says a
Russian author, “monuments of art, and miracles of luxury, the remains
of ages which had passed away, and those which had been the creation of
yesterday; the tombs of ancestors, and the nursery-cradles[9] of the
present generation, were indiscriminately destroyed. Nothing was left
of Moscow save the remembrance of the city, and the deep resolution to
avenge its fall.”

The fire raged till the 19th of September with unabated violence, and
then began to slacken for want of fuel. It is said four-fifths of this
great city were laid in ruins.—SIR WALTER SCOTT.

CHRISTMAS IN GERMANY.

I.


                                     Frankfort-on-the-Maine, Jan. 2, 1845.

We have lately[1] witnessed the most beautiful and interesting of
all German festivals—Christmas—which is celebrated in a style truly
characteristic of the[2] people. About the commencement of December, the
Christmarkt, or fair, was opened in the Römerberg[3], and has continued
to the present time. The booths, decorated with green boughs, were
filled with toys of various kinds, among which, during the first days,
the figure of St. Nicholas was conspicuous. There were[4] bunches of wax
candles to illuminate[5] the Christmas tree, gingerbread with printed
mottoes in poetry[6], beautiful little earthenware, basket-work, and
a wilderness[7] _of_ playthings. The sixth of December, being Nicholas
day[14], the booths were lighted up, and the square was filled with
boys, running from one stand to another, all shouting and talking
together in the most joyous confusion[8]. Nurses were going around,
carrying the smaller children in their arms, and parents bought presents
decorated with sprigs of pine and carried them away.

Many of the tables had _bundles of_ rods with gilded bands, which were to
be used that evening by the persons who represented St. Nicholas. In the
family with whom we reside, one of our German friends dressed himself[9]
very grotesquely with a mask, fur robe, and long tapering cap. He came
in with a _bunch of_ rods, a sack, and a broom for[10] sceptre. After we
all had received our share of the beating, he threw the contents of his
bag on the table, and while we were scrambling for the nuts and apples,
gave us many smart raps over the fingers. In many families the children
are made to say[11]: “I thank you[12], Herr Nicholas,” and the rods are
hung up in the room until Christmas, to keep them in good behaviour[13].
This[14] was only a forerunner of the “Christkindchen’s” coming. The
Nicholas is the punishing spirit, and the “Christkindchen” the rewarding
one.

CHRISTMAS IN GERMANY.

II.


When this time was over, we all began preparing secretly our presents for
Christmas. Every day there was[1] a consultation about the things which
should be obtained[2]. It was so arranged that we should interchange
presents, but nobody must[3] know beforehand what he would receive.
What pleasure there was in all these secret purchases and preparations!
Scarcely anything was thought or spoken of but Christmas, and every
day the consultations became more numerous and secret. The trees were
bought some time before-hand, but as we Americans were to witness the
festival for the first time, we were not allowed to see them prepared, in
order that the effect might be as great as possible. The market in the
Römerberg _Square_ grew constantly larger and more brilliant. Every night
it was illuminated with lamps and thronged with people. Quite a forest
sprang up in the street before our door. The old stone house opposite,
with the traces of so many centuries on its dark face, seemed to stand
in the midst of a garden. It was a pleasure to go out every evening and
see the children rushing to and fro, shouting and selecting toys from the
booths and talking all the time of the Christmas that was so near (S.
48, N. 6). The poor people went with[4] their little presents hid under
their cloaks, lest their children might see them; every heart was glad,
and every countenance wore a smile of secret pleasure.

Finally, the day before Christmas arrived. The streets were so full, I[5]
could scarcely make my way through[6], and the sale of trees went on[7]
more rapidly than ever. These were[8] usually branches of pine or fir,
set upright[9] in a little miniature garden of moss. When the lamps were
lighted at night, our street had the appearance of an illuminated garden.
We were prohibited from entering the rooms upstairs in which the grand
ceremony was to take place, being obliged[10] to take our seats in those
arranged for the guests, and to await with impatience the hour when the
“Christkindchen” should call us.

_Section 223._

CHRISTMAS IN GERMANY.

III.


Several relatives of the family came (S. 104, N. 19), and, what was more
agreeable, they brought with them five or six children. I was anxious
to see how they would view the ceremony[1]. Finally, in the midst of an
interesting conversation, we heard the bell ringing at the head of[2]
the stairs. We all started up, and made for[3] the door. I ran up the
steps with the children at my heels, and at the top met[4] a blaze of
dazzling light, coming from the open door. In each room stood a great
table, on which presents were arranged, amid flowers and wreaths. From[5]
the centre rose the beautiful Christmas tree, covered with wax tapers to
the very top, which made the room nearly as light as day[6], while every
bough was hung with sweetmeats and gilded nuts. The children ran shouting
around the table, hunting[7] their presents, while the older persons had
theirs pointed out to them. I had a little library of German authors _as
my share_; and many of the others received quite valuable gifts.

But how beautiful was the heartfelt joy that shone on every countenance!
As each one discovered his presents, he embraced the givers, and it was a
scene of unmingled joy[8]. It is a glorious feast, this Christmas time!
What a chorus from happy hearts went up on that evening to Heaven! Full
of poetry and feeling, and glad associations, it is here anticipated
with delight, and leaves a pleasant memory behind it. We may laugh at
such simple festivals at home, and prefer to shake ourselves loose
from every shackle[9] that bears the rust of the past, but we should
certainly be happier if some of these beautiful old customs were better
honoured. They renew the bond of feeling[10] between families and
friends, and strengthen their kindly sympathy; even life-long associates
require occasions of this kind to freshen the tie that binds them
together.—BAYARD TAYLOR, “VIEWS AFOOT.”

_Section 224._

NEW-YEAR’S EVE (S. 152, N. 1) IN GERMANY.


New-Year’s Eve is also favoured with a peculiar celebration[1] in
Germany. Everybody remains up and makes himself merry until midnight.
The Christmas trees are again lighted, and while the tapers are burning
out, the family play for[2] articles which they have purchased and hung
on the boughs. It is so arranged that each one shall win as much as he
gives, and the change[3] of articles creates much amusement. One of the
ladies rejoiced in the possession of a red silk handkerchief and a cake
of soap, while a cup and saucer and a pair of scissors fell to my lot. As
midnight drew near, the noise became louder in the streets, and companies
of people, some of them[4] singing in chorus, passed by on their way to
the Zeil[5]. Finally, it struck a quarter to twelve, the windows were
opened, and every one waited anxiously for the clock to strike twelve. At
the first sound, such a cry arose as one may imagine when thirty or forty
thousand persons all set their lungs going[6] at once. Everybody in the
house, in the street, over the whole city, shouted: “Prost Neujahr[7]!”

In families, all the members embrace each other, with wishes of happiness
for the new year. Then the windows are thrown open, and they cry to their
neighbours or those passing by.

After we had exchanged congratulations, three of us set out for the Zeil.
The streets were full of people, shouting to one another and to those
standing at the open windows. We failed not to cry: “Prost Neujahr!”
wherever we saw a damsel at the window, and the words came back to us
more musically than we sent them. Along the Zeil the spectacle was
most singular. The great wide street was filled with companies of men,
marching up and down, while from the mass rang up one deafening, unending
shout, that seemed to pierce the black sky above. The whole scene looked
stranger and wilder in the flickering light of the swinging lamps[8], and
I could not help thinking it must resemble a night in Paris, during the
French Revolution.—BAYARD TAYLOR, “VIEWS AFOOT.”

street on ropes which were attached to the houses on both sides of the
street.

THE TWO ROBBERS.

    WE OFTEN CONDEMN IN OTHERS WHAT WE PRACTISE OURSELVES.

(Alexander the Great in his tent. A man with a fierce countenance,
chained and fettered, brought before him.)

ALEXANDER.—What, art thou the Thracian robber, of whose exploits I have
heard so much?

ROBBER.—I am a Thracian, and a soldier.

ALEXANDER.—A soldier?—a thief, a plunderer, an assassin! the pest of the
country! I could honour thy courage, but I must detest and punish thy
crimes.

ROBBER.—What have I done of which you can complain[1]?

ALEXANDER.—Hast thou not set at defiance my authority, violated the
public peace, and passed thy life[2] in injuring the persons[3] and
properties of thy fellow-subjects[4]?

ROBBER.—Alexander! I am your captive. I must hear what you please to say,
and endure what you please to inflict. But my soul is unconquered; and if
I reply at all[5] to your reproaches, I will reply like a free man.

ALEXANDER.—Speak freely. Far be it from me to take[6] the advantage of my
power, to silence those with whom I deign to converse!

ROBBER.—I must then answer your question by another. How have you passed
your life?

ALEXANDER.—Like a hero. Ask Fame[7], and she will tell you. Among the
brave, I have been the bravest; among sovereigns, the noblest; among
conquerors, the mightiest.

[1] +sich über etwas beklagen.+ Use the 2nd person Plural when the robber
addresses Alexander.

[2] +und dein Leben damit zugebracht.+

[3] = the personal safety.

[4] +deiner Nebenmenschen.+

[5] +überhaupt.+

[6] = to use.

_Section 226._

THE TWO ROBBERS.

II.


ROBBER.—And does not Fame speak of me too? Was there (S. 82, N. 7) ever
a bolder captain of a more valiant band? Was there ever—but I scorn to
boast. You yourself know that I have not been easily subdued.

ALEXANDER.—Still, what are you but a robber, a base, dishonest robber?

ROBBER.—And what is a conqueror? Have not you, too, gone about the
earth[1] like an evil genius, blasting[2] the fair fruits of peace and
industry, plundering, ravaging, killing[3] without law, without justice,
merely to gratify an insatiable lust for dominion? All that I have done
to a single district with _a_ hundred followers, you have done to whole
nations with a hundred thousand. If I have stripped individuals[4], you
(S. 27, N. 8) have ruined kings and princes. If I have burned a few
hamlets, you have desolated the most flourishing kingdoms and cities of
the earth. What is then the difference[5], but that, as you were born a
king, and I a private man[6], you have been able to become a mightier
robber than I?

ALEXANDER.—But if I have taken like a king, I have given like a king. If
I have subverted empires, I have founded greater. I have cherished[7]
arts, commerce, and philosophy.

ROBBER.—I, too, have freely given to the poor, what I took from the rich.
I have established order and discipline among the most ferocious of
mankind[8], and have stretched out my protecting arm over the oppressed.
I know, indeed, little of the philosophy you talk of; but I believe
neither you nor I will ever atone to the world for the mischiefs we have
done.

ALEXANDER.—Leave me!—Take off his chains, and use him well. Are we, then,
so much like?—Alexander and a Robber?—Let me reflect[9].—DR. AIKIN.

[1] ‘to go about the earth’ here +über die Erde her´ziehen+, conjugated
with +sein+.

[2] = to (+um ... zu+) blast, +vernichten+.

[3] = Have you not plundered, ravaged and killed.

[4] = robbed common citizens.

A TOUCHING SCENE AT SEA.

I.


Two weeks ago[1] on board an English steamer, a little ragged boy, aged
nine years, was discovered on the fourth day of the voyage _out_ from
Liverpool to New York, and carried before the first mate, whose duty
it was to deal with such cases. When questioned as to his object in
being stowed away[2], and who brought him on board, the boy, who had
a beautiful sunny face, and eyes that looked like the very mirrors of
truth, replied that his stepfather did it, because he could not afford[3]
to keep him, nor to pay his passage _out_ to Halifax, where he had an
aunt who[4] was well off, and to whose house he was going. The mate did
not believe the story, in spite of the winning face and truthful[5]
accents of the boy. He had seen too much of stow-aways[6] to be easily
deceived by them, he said; and it was his firm conviction that the boy
had been brought on board and provided with food by the sailors. The
little fellow was very roughly handled in consequence. Day by day he was
questioned and re-questioned, but always with the same result. He did not
know a sailor on board, and his father alone had secreted him, and given
him the food which he ate. At[7] last the mate, wearied by the boy’s
persistence in the same story, and perhaps a little anxious to inculpate
the sailors, seized him one day by the collar, and dragging him to the
fore[8], told him that (S. 211, N. 9) unless he would tell the truth in
ten minutes from that time, he would hang him from the yard-arm.

[1] +Vor vierzehn Tagen+, after which place predicate and subject [one
discovered], since, as a rule, only _one_ part of the adjuncts to the
predicate should be placed before it.

[2] as — away = +warum er aufs Schiff geschmuggelt sei+ (App. §§ 28 and
30).

[3] I cannot afford to keep you, +meine Mittel gestatten mir nicht, dich
zu ernähren+.

[4] The relative clause ‘who — off’ may be avoided by using the adjective
‘+wohlhabend+’ before ‘aunt’.

[5] here +glaubwürdig+; accents, +Sprache+.

[6] ‘the stow-away’ may perhaps be rendered by +der Eingeschmuggelte+.

[7] It will easily be seen that, on account of the length of this period
and of the many dependent clauses contained therein, it requires an
altogether different form of construction in German. The author will,
however, refrain from indicating the form to be used, the student being
by this time expected to have attained sufficient skill and practice for
dealing with such cases.

[8] +aufs Vorderteil des Schiffes+.

He then made him sit down under it on the deck. All around him were
the passengers and sailors of the watch, and in front of him stood the
inexorable mate, with his chronometer in his hand, and the other officers
of the ship by his side. It was the finest sight, said our informant[1],
that he ever beheld—to see the pale, proud, sorrowful face of that noble
boy, his head erect, his beautiful eyes bright through the tears that
suffused them. When eight minutes had fled[2], the mate told him he had
but two minutes to live, and advised him to speak the truth and save his
life; but he replied with the utmost simplicity and sincerity by asking
(S. 111, N. 6) the mate if he might pray. The mate said nothing, but
nodded his head, turned as pale as a ghost[3], and shook _with trembling_
like a reed with[4] the wind. And there, all eyes turned on him, the
brave and noble little fellow, this poor waif, whom society owned not,
and whose own stepfather could not care for him—there he knelt, with
clasped hands, and eyes turned up to heaven, while he repeated[5] audibly
the Lord’s Prayer, and prayed the Lord Jesus to take him to heaven. There
then occurred (S. 104, N. 19) a scene as at Pentecost. Sobs broke[6] from
the strong hard hearts, as the mate sprang forward to the boy, and kissed
and blessed him, and told him how sincerely he believed his story, and
how glad he was that he had been willing enough to face death[7] and to
sacrifice his life for the truth of his word.—REV. E. DAVIES.

[1] Place ‘said — informant (here +Gewährsmann+, m.)’ after ‘that —

AN ORATION ON THE POWER OF HABIT.

I.


I will now speak of a habit which I believe[1] is, more than any other,
debasing, degrading, and embruting to man[2], both[3] physically,
intellectually, and morally. I am not going to give you an address[4]
_full_ of my favourite theme [temperance], but I must speak of it[5]. I
must speak of it before this assembly, for I shall never see you again
till we meet on that day when we shall see things as they are[6]. Let me
then speak of one habit which, in its power, and[7] influence, and[8]
fascination, seems to rear its head like a Goliath or Saul above all
its kindred agencies of demoralization; I allude to[9] the habit of
using intoxicating liquors as a beverage, until that habit becomes a
fascination[10]. You will allow me to give[11] my opinions upon these
points freely. I consider drunkenness not merely to be a moral evil,
but also a physical evil, and[12] it depends a great deal more upon the
temperament, _and_ the constitution, and disposition of the young man,
whether if he falls into the drinking usages of society, it becomes a
habit or not, than it does upon his strength of mind or firmness of
purpose[13].

Take a young man, and he shall be full of fire[14] and poetry. He shall
be[15] of a nervous temperament and generous heart; fond of society, and
open and manly in everything he does. Every one loves him. That is the
man most liable to become intemperate.

[1] = as I believe.

[2] is ... to man, +auf den Menschen wirkt+.

[6] Render ‘for — are’ Liter. = for we shall see one another only (S.

in their true form (+Gestalt+, f.).

intoxicating liquors, it depends, etc.’

[13] his — purpose, +seine Geistes- oder Willenskraft+.

AN ORATION ON THE POWER OF HABIT.

II.


He enters[1] into the outer circle of the whirlpool, and throws care to
the winds[2]. There he thinks to stay, but he gets nearer and nearer
to the fatal gulf, until he is swept into the vortex before he dreamed
of danger. This thing, habit[3], comes gradually. Many a man who has
acquired[4] a habit of drinking, but does not exactly proceed to
excess[5], is rescued simply by possessing certain physical qualities
which his poor unfortunate friend had not. You say: “I am not so foolish
as to become a drunkard!” So He thought once. You say: “I can leave it
off[6] when I like,” as if He at first had not had (App. § 33) the power
to leave it off when he liked. You say: “I have too sound an intellect to
become a drunkard,” as if He were born without an intellect. You say: “I
have too much pride in myself, too much self-respect,” as if He were not
once as proud as you. _The way_ men acquire this habit, _is_ by looking
on those[7] who proceed to excess as naturally inferior to themselves.
The difference between you and the drunkard is just this, that you could
leave off[8] the habit, but won’t; he would[9] with all his heart and
soul, but cannot. I tell you, young men[10], that while the power of a
bad habit is stripping you of nerve [pl.], _and_ (S. 10, N. 9) energy,
and freshness of feeling[11], it does not destroy your responsibility.
You are accountable to God for every power, _and_ talent, and influence
with which you have been endowed.

If you say: “Should I find the practice by experience to be injurious, I
will give it up,” surely that is not common sense[1]. You might as well
say: “I will put my hand into the nest of the rattlesnake, and when I
find out that he has stuck his fangs into me[2], I will draw it out and
get cured.”

I remember riding from[3] Buffalo to the Niagara Falls, and said to
a gentleman: “What river is that, Sir?” “That,” he said, “is Niagara
River[4].” “Well, it is a beautiful stream,” said I, “bright, and fair,
and glossy; how far off are the rapids[5]?” “Only a mile or two,” was
the reply. “Is it possible that (S. 66, N. 15) only a mile or two from
us we shall find the water in the turbulence which it must show _when_
near the falls?” “You will find it so, Sir.” And so I did find it; and
that first sight of the Niagara I shall never forget. Now, launch your
boat on that Niagara river; it is bright, smooth, beautiful, and glossy.
There is a ripple at the bow[6], and the silvery wake[7] you leave behind
adds to your enjoyment. Down the stream you glide; oars, sails, and helm
are in proper trim, and you set out[8] on your pleasure excursion[9].
Suddenly some one cries out from the bank: “Young men, ahoy[10]!” “What
is it[11]!”—“The rapids are below you[12]!”—“Ha, ha! we have heard of the
rapids, but we are not so foolish as to get there[13]. If we go [= If
it goes] too fast, then up with the helm[14], then set the mast in the

A CURIOUS STORY[1].

I.


We heard a curious story at Tristan[2] about two Germans who had settled
nearly two years before on Inaccessible Island[3]. Once a year, about
the month _of_ December, the Tristan men go[4] to the two outlying
islands to pick up the few seals which are still to be found there. On
two of these occasions they had seen the Germans, and within a few months
smoke had risen from the island, which they attributed[5] to their having
fired (S. 161, N. 21) some of the brushwood; but as they had seen or
heard nothing of them since, they thought the probability was that they
had perished. Captain Nares[6] wished to visit the other islands, and to
ascertain the fate of the two men was an additional object in doing so[7].

Next morning we were close under Inaccessible Island, the second in size
of the little group of three. The ship was surrounded by multitudes of
penguins[8], and as few of us had any previous personal acquaintance with
this eccentric form of life[9], we followed their movements with great
interest. The penguin as a rule swims under water, rising now and then
and resting on the surface, like one of the ordinary water-birds, but
more frequently with its body entirely covered, and only lifting its head
from time to time to breathe.

The structure of Inaccessible Island is very much the same as Tristan,
only the pre-eminent feature[10] of the latter, the snowy cone, is
wanting. A wall of volcanic rocks, about the same height as the cliff
at Tristan, and which one is inclined to believe to have been at one
time continuous with it, entirely surrounds Inaccessible Island, falling
for the most part sheer[11] into the sea, and it seems that it slopes
sufficiently to allow a tolerably easy ascent to the plateau on the top
at one point only.

[1] This story is taken from Mr. W. J. J. Spry’s most interesting account
of ‘The Cruise of the Challenger’. The Tristan d’Acunha group of islands
(+die Erfrischungsinseln+), so named from the Portuguese navigator
who discovered it early in the 16th century, lies in mid-ocean, about
1300 miles south of St. Helena and 1500 miles west of the Cape of Good
Hope, nearly on a line between the Cape of Good Hope and Cape Horn;
it is thus probably the most isolated and remote of all the abodes of
men. The group consists of the larger Island of Tristan and two smaller
islands—Inaccessible Island, about 18 miles south-west from Tristan, and
Nightingale Island, twenty miles south of the main island. Tristan only
is permanently inhabited, the other two are visited from time to time by
sealers. In the year 1829 Tristan was inhabited by 27 families; in 1836
it possessed a population of 42; in 1852 the population had risen to 85,
and in 1867 this number was only exceeded by one.

[2] +Auf der Insel Tristan+, which place at the head of the period;
about, +über+, with Acc.

[3] The author finds that the best German maps use the English name of
‘Inaccessible Island’ unaltered. This is also the case with ‘Nightingale
Island’.

[4] +fahren+; =‘to go’, when used in the sense of ‘travelling, riding

There is a shallow bay in which the ship anchored in fifteen fathoms on
the east side of the island; and there, as in Tristan, a narrow belt of
low ground, extending for about a mile along the shore, is interposed
between the cliff and the sea. A pretty waterfall tossed itself down,
about the middle of the bay, over the cliff from the plateau above.
A little way down it was nearly lost in spray, like the Staubbach of
Schaffhausen, and collected itself again into a rivulet[1], where it
regained the rock at the lower level. A hut built of stones and clay,
and roofed with spars and thatch, lay in a little hollow[2] near the
waterfall, and the two Germans, in excellent health and spirits, but
enraptured at the sight of the ship and longing for a passage anywhere
out of the island, were[3] down on the beach, waiting for the first
boat. Their story is a curious one[4], and as Captain Nares agreed[5]
to take them to the Cape, we had ample time to get an account of their
adventures, and to supplement from their experience such crude notions of
the nature of the place as we could gather during our short stay[6].

Frederick and Gustav Stoltenhoff are sons of a dyer in Aix-la-Chapelle
(+Aachen+). Frederick, the elder, was employed in a merchant’s office
in Aix-la-Chapelle at the time of the Franco-German war (1870). He was
called on to serve in the German army, where he attained the rank of a
lieutenant, and took part in the siege of Metz and Thionville. At the
end of the campaign he was discharged, and returned home to find his old
situation filled up.

In the meantime, his younger brother, Gustav, who was a sailor and had
already made several trips, had joined[1] on the 1st of August, 1870,
at Greenock, as an ordinary seaman, the English ship “Beacon Light,”
bound for Rangoon. On the way out[2], the cargo, which consisted of
coal, caught fire[3] when they were from[4] six to seven hundred miles
north-west of Tristan d’Acunha, and for (S. 166, N. 10) three days all
hands[5] were doing their utmost to extinguish the fire. On the third
day, the hatches, which had been battened down, to exclude the air, blew
up[6], the main hatch carrying overboard[7] the second mate who had
been standing on it at the time of the explosion. The boats had been
provisioned beforehand, ready to leave the ship. Two of the crew were
drowned through one of the boats being swamped[8], and the survivors,
to the number of sixteen, were stowed in the long-boat. Up to this time
the ship had been nearing Tristan with a fair wind at the rate of[9] six
knots an hour[10], so that they had now only about three hundred miles to
go. They abandoned the ship on Friday; on Saturday afternoon they sighted
Tristan, and on the following day a boat came off to their assistance and
towed them ashore.

The shipwrecked crew remained for eighteen days at Tristan d’Acunha,
during which time they were treated with all kindness and hospitality.
They were relieved by the ill-fated “Northfleet,” bound for Aden with
coal, and Gustav Stoltenhoff found his way back to Aix-la-Chapelle.

During his stay at Tristan he heard that a large number of seals were to
be had among the islands[1], and he seems to have been greatly pleased
with the Tristaners and to have formed a project of returning there.
When he got home, his brother had just got back from the war and was
unemployed; he infected him with his notion[2], and the two agreed[3] to
join in a venture to Tristan to see what they could (App. § 33) make[4]
by seal-hunting and barter.

They accordingly sailed for[5] St. Helena in August 1871, and on the 6th
of November left St. Helena for Tristan in an American whaler bound on
a cruise[6] in the South Atlantic. The captain of the whaler, who had
been often at Tristan d’Acunha, had some doubt of the reception which the
young men would get[7] if they went as permanent settlers[8] there, and
he spoke so strongly of the advantages of Inaccessible Island, on account
of the greater productiveness of the soil, and of its being the centre[9]
of the seal-fishing, that they changed their plans and were landed on
the west side of Inaccessible Island on the 27th of November 1871,—early
in summer. A quarter of an hour after, the whaler departed, leaving them
the only inhabitants of one of the most remote spots on the face of the
earth. They do not seem, however, to have been in the least depressed by
their isolation.

The same day the younger brother clambered up to the plateau with the
help of the tussock grass[10], in search of goats or pigs, and remained
there all night, and on the following day the two set to work to build
themselves a hut for shelter. They had reached the end of their voyage by
no means unprovided, and the inventory of their belongings[11] is curious.

They had an old whale-boat[1] which they had bought at St. Helena, with
mast, sails, and oars, three spars for a roof, a door, and a glazed
window; a wheel-barrow, two spades and a shovel, two pickaxes, a saw,
a hammer, two chisels, two or three gimlets, and some nails; a kettle,
a frying-pan, two sauce-pans, knives and forks, and some crockery; two
blankets each, and empty covers[2] which they afterwards filled with
sea-birds’ down. They had a lamp, a bottle of oil, and six dozen boxes of
Bryant and May’s matches.

For internal use[3] they had two hundred pounds _of_ flour, two hundred
pounds _of_ rice, one hundred pounds _of_ biscuits, twenty pounds _of_
coffee, ten pounds _of_ tea, thirty pounds _of_ sugar, three pounds _of_
table-salt, a little pepper, eight pounds _of_ tobacco, five bottles
_of_ gin, six bottles _of_ Cape wine[4], six bottles _of_ vinegar, and
some Epsom salts. A barrel _of_ coarse salt was provided for curing
seal-skins, and forty empty casks were intended for oil. Their arms
and ammunition consisted of a short English rifle, an old German
fowling-piece, two and a half pounds _of_ powder, two hundred bullets,
and four sheath-knives[5]. The captain of the whaler gave them some seed
potatoes, and they had a collection of the ordinary garden seeds.

When they had been four days on the island, they had a visit from a party
of men from Tristan, who had come on their annual sealing excursion.
They were ten days on Inaccessible, and were very friendly in their
intercourse with the new comers.

They told them that the north side of the island was better suited for
a settlement, and transported all their goods (S. 236, N. 11) thither
in one of their boats. Being familiar with the place, they showed them
generally their way about and the different passes by which the plateau
might be reached, and they taught them how to build[1] to withstand the
violent winds, and how to thatch with tussock-grass. Immediately after
they left, the brothers set about building a house and clearing some
ground[2] for potatoes and other vegetables. They killed nineteen seals,
and prepared the skins, but they were unable to make any[3] quantity of
oil. Towards the end of the sealing season their boat got damaged in the
surf, and they were obliged to cut it in two[4], patch up the best half
of it, and use it as best they could[5] in smooth weather, close to shore.

They went from time to time to the upper plateau and shot goats and pigs.
When they first arrived, they counted a flock of twenty-three goats;
three of these were killed during the summer of 1871-1872 by the Tristan
people (S. 157, N. 4), and six by themselves; the remaining fourteen
remained over the winter of 1872. The flesh of the goats they found
extremely delicate. Pigs were much more numerous, but their flesh was not
so palatable, from their feeding[6] principally on sea-birds; that of the
boars was especially rank. They found the pigs very valuable, however, in
yielding an abundant supply of lard[7], which they used for frying their
potatoes.

VII.


In the month of April 1872, a singular misfortune befell them. While
burning some of the brushwood below to make a clearing, the tussock-grass
in the gully[1], by which they had been in the habit[2] of ascending the
cliff, caught fire, and as it had been only by its assistance that they
had been able to scramble up to the plateau, their only hunting-ground
was now inaccessible from the strip of beach on which their hut and
garden stood, which was closed in on either side by a headland jutting
into the sea. While their half-boat remained seaworthy, they were able
to paddle round in fine weather to the west side of the island, where
there was an access to the top; but the “sea-cart,” as they called it,
was washed off the beach and broken up in June, and after that the only
way they had of reaching the plateau was by swimming round the headland—a
risky feat, even in the finest weather, in these wild regions.

In winter it was found to be impossible to reach the terrace, and as
their supply of food was low, they experienced considerable privations
during their first winter. Their daily allowance of food was reduced to a
quantity just sufficient to maintain life, and in August they were little
better than skeletons[3].

Help was, however, near. Early in August a multitude of penguins
landed[4] hard by their hut,—stupid[5] animals, which will scarcely get
out of one’s way, and are easily knocked down with a stick[6], and with
fleshy breasts, wholesome enough, though with a rather fishy taste;
and in the end of August the females began to lay large blue eggs,
sufficiently delicate in flavour.

VIII.


A French barque hove-to off the beach[1] in the middle of September,
and in her they shipped their seal-skins, and bartered penguins’ eggs
with her for biscuits and tobacco. Had the bark arrived a week earlier,
the brothers would have left the island; but the eggs had set them up
again[2], and they determined to remain a little longer. In October, a
schooner, which proved[3] to be “The Themis,” a whaler from the cape of
Good Hope, was seen standing towards the island. A gale _of wind_ blew[4]
her off for a couple of days, but she returned and landed some men from
Tristan, who had crossed[5] to see what the hermits were about[6]. Their
guests remained a day and a half, and then returned to Tristan.

Early in November, that is, early in the second summer, the brothers
thus swam round the eastern headland:—Frederick with their blankets, the
rifle, and a spare suit of clothes[7]—Gustav with powder, matches, and
the kettle in an oil-cask. They mounted by the help of the tussock-grass
to the top of the cliff, went over to the west side of the plateau, and
there built a small hut, where they remained a month, living on goats’
flesh and fresh pork.

On the 10th of December they returned home, mended their thatch, dug[8]
the early potatoes, and put the garden in order.

On the 19th of December the Tristan men made their second sealing
expedition. They remained nine days on the island, and killed forty
seals, one sea-elephant, and eight of the remaining[9] twelve goats.
They left some flour in exchange for an oil-cask, and this was the
last communication between the brothers and the outer world until the
“Challenger” called eight months later.

In January Frederick swam round the point[1] again, and mounted the
cliff. He shot four pigs, ran[2] the fat into buckets, and threw the hams
down to his brother on the beach below. He saw the four last goats, but
spared[3] them to increase their number. In February a boat came to the
west side from Tristan, and its crew killed the four goats, and departed
without communicating with the Stoltenhoffs[4].

The relations between the Tristan people and the brothers does not appear
to have been so cordial latterly as it was at first, and the Stoltenhoffs
believe that[5] the intention of their neighbours in killing the goats,
and in delaying from time to time to bring them some live stock, which
they had promised them, was to force them to leave the island. It may
have been so, for the Tristan men had been in the habit of making a
yearly sealing expedition to Inaccessible Island, and no doubt the
presence of the energetic strangers lessened their chance of success.

In March the brothers once more swam round the point, and ascended the
cliff. After staying on the plateau together for a few days, it was
settled that Frederick should remain above to procure (S. 58, N. 8) a
stock of lard for the winter, Gustav returning to the hut and storing
it[6]. When a pig was killed, the hide, with the fat in it, was rolled
up, secured with thongs of skin, and thrown over the cliff, where Gustav
then ran the lard into a cask.

During the second winter, the privations of the brothers do not seem to
have been great. They were getting accustomed to their mode of life, and
had always sufficient food, such as it was[1]. They were remarkably well
educated. Both could speak and read English fluently, and the elder had
a good knowledge of French. Their library consisted of eight volumes:
Schoedler’s Natural History, a German Atlas, Charles O’Malley, Captain
Morrell’s Voyages, two old volumes of a monthly magazine[2], Hamlet and
Coriolanus with French notes, and Schiller’s poems. These books they
came to know almost by heart[3], but they had considerable resources in
themselves, in the intelligent interest they took in the ever-changing
appearances of nature.

When the “Challenger” arrived, they were preparing for another summer;
but the peculiar food, and the want of variety in it, were beginning
to tell upon them, for all their original stores were exhausted, with
the exception of the Epsom salts, which were untouched, neither of them
having had an hour’s illness during their sojourn; and they were heartily
glad of a passage to the Cape.

Frederick came to the ship before we left for the South in December. He
was then comfortably settled in a situation in a merchant’s office in
Cape Town, and Gustav was on his way home to see his people[4] before
resuming the thread of his roving sailor’s life.—W. J. J. SPRY, “THE

HOW THE BANK OF ENGLAND WAS HUMBLED.

I.


Once, many years ago, a bill of exchange for a large amount was drawn[1]
by Anselm Rothschild, of Frankfort, on Nathan Rothschild, of London. When
the gentleman who held it arrived in London, Nathan was away, and he took
the bit of paper to the Bank of England and asked them to discount it.

The managers were very stiff. With haughty assurance they informed the
holder that they discounted only their own bills; they said they had
nothing to do with the bills of private persons. They did not stop to
reflect with whom they had to deal. Those shrewd old gentlemen in charge
of the bank of the realm should have known and remembered that that
bit of paper bore the signature of a man more powerful than they—more
powerful, because independent of a thousand-and-one hampers that rested
upon them. “Umph,” exclaimed Nathan Rothschild, when the answer of the
Bank was repeated to him. “Private persons! I will let these important
gentlemen know with what sort of private persons they have to deal.”

And then Nathan Rothschild went to work. He had an object in view[2]—to
humble the Bank of England—and he meant to do it[3]. He sent agents to
the Continent and through the United Kingdom, and three weeks were spent
in gathering up notes of the smaller denominations of the Bank’s own
issue[4].

One morning, bright and early, Nathan Rothschild presented himself at
the Bank, and drew forth from his pocket-book a five-pound note, which
he desired to have cashed. Five sovereigns were counted out to him, the
officers looking with astonishment upon seeing Baron Rothschild troubling
himself personally about so trivial a matter. The baron examined the
coins one by one, and, having satisfied himself of their good quality,
slipped them into a canvas bag, and then drew out and presented another
five-pound note. The same operation was repeated, save that the baron
took the trouble to take a small pair of scales from his pocket to weigh
one of the pieces, for the law gave him that right.

HOW THE BANK OF ENGLAND WAS HUMBLED.

II.


Two—three—ten—twenty—a hundred—five hundred five-pound notes were
presented and cashed. When one pocket-book was emptied, another was
brought forth; and when a canvas bag had been filled with gold, it was
passed to a servant who was in waiting. And so he went on until the
hour arrived for closing the Bank; at the same time he had nine of the
employés of his house engaged in the same work. So it resulted that ten
men of the house of Rothschild had kept every teller[1] of the Bank busy
for seven hours, and exchanged _somewhere_ about £22,000. Not another
customer had been able to get his wants attended to. The English like
oddity. Let a man do anything original, and they will generally applaud.
So the people of the Bank contrived to smile[2] at the eccentricity of
Baron Rothschild, and when the time came for closing the Bank, they were
not a tenth part so much annoyed as were[3] the customers from abroad[4]
whose business had not been attended to. The bank officials smiled that
evening, but—

On the following morning, when the bank opened[5], Nathan Rothschild
appeared again, accompanied by his nine faithful helpers, this time
bringing with him, as far as the street entrance, four heavy two-horse
drays, for the purpose of carting away the gold, for to-day the baron had
bills of a larger amount. Ah! the officers of the Bank smiled no more,
and a trembling seized them when the banker monarch said, with stern
simplicity and directness:

“Ah! these gentlemen refuse to take my bills! Be it so. I am resolved
that I will not keep one of theirs. It is the House of Rothschild against
the Bank of England[6].” The Bank of England opened its eyes very wide.
Within a week, the House of Rothschild could be demanding gold which it
did not possess. The gentlemen at the head of affairs saw very plainly
that in a determined tilt[7] the Bank must go to the wall[8]. There was
but one way out of the dilemma, and they took it. Notice was at once
publicly given[9] that thenceforth the Bank of England would cash the
bills of Rothschild _the same_ as its own.—TIT-BITS.

MORGAN PRUSSIA[1].

I.


Morgan, the gay and handsome son of a low Irish farmer, tired of home,
went to take the chances of the world, and seek his fortune. By what
means he traversed England, or made his way to France, is not told. But
he at length crossed France, and, probably without much knowledge or
much care whether he was moving to the north or the south pole, found
himself in the Prussian territory. This was in the day of Frederick
William I. (1713-1740), famous for his tall regiment of guards. He
had but one ambition, that of inspecting twice a day a regiment of
a thousand grenadiers, not one of whom was less than six feet and a
half high. Morgan was an Irish giant, and was instantly seized by the
Prussian recruiting sergeants, who forced him to “volunteer” into the
tall battalion. This turn of fate was totally out of the Irishman’s
calculation; and the prospect of carrying a musket till his dying day on
the Potsdam parade[2], after having made up his mind to live by his wits
and rove the world, more than once tempted him to think of leaving his
musket and honour behind him, and fairly trying his chance for escape.
But the attempt was always found impracticable; the frontier was too
closely watched, and Morgan still marched up and down the Potsdam parade
with a disconsolate heart, when one evening a Turkish recruit was brought
in; for the king looked to nothing but the thews and sinews of a man, and
the Turk was full seven feet high.

“How much did his majesty give for catching that heathen?” said Morgan
to his corporal. “Four hundred dollars[3],” was the answer. Morgan burst
out into an exclamation of astonishment at this waste of royal treasure
upon a Turk. “Why, they cannot be got for less,” replied the corporal.
“What a pity my five brothers cannot hear of it!” said Morgan, “I am a
dwarf to any one of them, and the sound of half the money would bring
them all over immediately.” As the discovery of a tall recruit was
the well-known road to favoritism, five were worth at least a pair of
colours to the corporal[4]. The conversation was immediately carried to
the sergeant, and from him, through the gradation of officers, to the
colonel, who took the first opportunity of mentioning it to the king.
The colonel was instantly ordered to question Morgan; but he at once
lost all recollection of the subject. “He had no brothers; he had made
the regiment his father, and mother, and relations, and there he hoped
to live and die.” But he was urged still more strongly, and at length
confessed that he had brothers, even above the regimental standard, but
that nothing on earth could stir them from their spades.

MORGAN PRUSSIA.

II.


After some time the king inquired for the five recruits, and was
indignant when he was told of the impossibility of enlisting them. “Send
the fellow himself,” he exclaimed, “and let him bring them back.” The
order was given; but Morgan was broken-hearted “at the idea of so long
an absence from the regiment.” He applied to the colonel to have the
order revoked, or at least given to some one else. But this was out of
the question, for the king’s word was always irrevocable; and Morgan,
with a disconsolate face, prepared to set out upon his mission. But a new
difficulty struck him. “How was he to make his brothers come, unless he
showed them the recruiting money?” This objection was at last obviated by
the advance of a sum equal to about three hundred pounds sterling, as a
first instalment for the purchase of his family. Like a loyal grenadier
the Irishman was now ready to attempt anything for his colonel or his
king, and Morgan began his journey. But, as he was stepping out of the
gates of Potsdam, another difficulty occurred; and he returned to tell
the colonel that of all people existing the Irish were the most apt to
doubt a traveller’s story, they being in the habit of a good deal of
exercise in that style themselves[1]; and that when he should go back
to his own country, and tell them of the capital treatment and sure
promotion that a soldier met with in the guards, the probability was,
that they would laugh in his face. As to the money, “there were some who
would not scruple to say that he stole it, or tricked some one out of
it. But, undoubtedly, when they saw him walking back only as a common
soldier, he was sure they would not believe a syllable, let him say what
he would about rising in the service.”

The objection was intelligible enough, and the colonel represented it to
the king, who, doubly outrageous at the delay, swore a grenadier’s oath,
ordered Morgan to be made a sub-lieutenant, and, with sword and epaulets,
sent him instantly across the Rhine to convince his five brothers of the
rapidity of Prussian promotion. Morgan flew to his home in the county
_of_ Carlow, delighted the firesides for many a mile round with his
having outwitted a king and a whole battalion of grenadiers, laid out his
recruiting money on land, and became a man of estate at the expense of
the Prussian treasury.

One ceremony remains to be recorded. Once a year, on the anniversary of
the day on which he left Potsdam and its giants behind, he climbed a hill
within a short distance of his house, turned himself in the direction
of Prussia, and, with the most contemptuous gesture which he could
contrive, bade good-bye to his majesty. The ruse was long a great source
of amusement, and its hero, like other heroes, bore through life the name
earned by his exploit—Morgan Prussia.—KING GEORGE THE FOURTH.

_Section 247._

THE TERRIBLE WINTER OF 1784.


About the middle of the month of April, in the year 1784, three hundred
thousand miserable beings, dying from cold and hunger, groaned in Paris
alone—in that Paris where, in spite of the boast that scarcely another
city contained so many rich people, nothing had been prepared to prevent
the poor from perishing of cold and wretchedness.

For the last four months, the same leaden sky had driven the poor from
the villages into the town, as it sent the wolves from the woods into the
villages.

No more bread. No more wood.

No more bread for those who felt this cold—and no more wood to bake it.
All the provisions which had been collected, Paris had devoured in a
month. The Provost, short-sighted and incapable, did not know how to
procure for Paris, which was under his care, the wood which might have
been collected in the neighbourhood. When it froze, he said the frost
prevented the horses from bringing it; when it thawed, he pleaded want of
horses and conveyances. Louis XVI., ever good and humane, always ready to
attend to the physical wants of his people, although he overlooked their
social ones, began by contributing a sum of 200,000 francs for horses and
carts, and insisting on their immediate use. Still the demand continued
greater than the supply.

At first no one was allowed to carry away from the public timber-yard
more than a cart-load of wood; then that was limited to half the
quantity. Soon long strings of people might be seen waiting outside
the timber-yards, as they were afterwards seen at the bakers’ shops.
The king gave away the whole of his private income in charity. He
procured 3,000,000 francs by a grant and applied it to the relief of the
sufferers, declaring that every other need must give way before that of
cold and famine. The queen, on her part, gave 500 louis from her purse.
The convents, the hospitals, and the public buildings were thrown open
as places of asylum for the poor, who came in crowds for the sake of the
fires that were kept there.

They kept hoping for a thaw, but heaven seemed inflexible. Every evening
the same copper-coloured sky disappointed their hopes; and the stars
shone bright and clear as funeral torches through the long, cold nights,
which hardened again and again the snow that fell during the day. All day
long, thousands of workmen, with spades and shovels, cleared away the
snow from before the houses, so that on each side of the streets, already
too narrow for the traffic, rose a high, thick wall, blocking up the way.
Soon these masses of snow and ice became so large that the shops were
obscured by them, and they were obliged to allow it to remain where it
fell.

Paris could do no more. She gave in, and allowed the winter to do its
worst. December, January, February, and March passed thus, although now
and then a few days’ thaw changed the streets, whose sewers were blocked
up, into running streams. Horses were drowned, and carriages destroyed,
in the streets, some of which could only be traversed in boats. People
went to the markets to see the fisherwomen serving their customers with
immense leathern boots on, inside which their trousers were pushed,
and with their petticoats tucked round their waists, all laughing,
gesticulating, and splashing each other as they stood in the water.

These thaws, however, were but transitory; the frost returned, harder
and more obstinate than ever, and recourse was had to sledges, pushed
along by skaters, or drawn by roughshod horses along the causeways, which
were like polished mirrors. The Seine, frozen many feet deep, had become
the place of rendezvous for all idlers, who assembled there to skate or
slide, until, warmed by exercise, they ran to the nearest fire, lest the
perspiration should freeze upon them. All trembled for the time when, the
water communications being stopped, and the roads impassable, provisions
could no longer be sent in, and began to fear that Paris would perish
from want.

The king, in this extremity, called a council. They decided to implore
all bishops, abbés, and monks to leave Paris and retire to their dioceses
or convents; and all those magistrates and officials who, preferring the
opera to their duties, had crowded to Paris, to return to their homes;
for all these people used large quantities of wood in their hotels, and
consumed no small amount of food. There were still the country gentlemen,
who were also to be entreated to leave. But M. Lenoir, lieutenant
of police, observed to the king that, as none of these people were
criminals, and could not therefore be compelled to leave Paris in a day,
they would probably be so long thinking about it, that the thaw would
come before their departure, which would then be more hurtful than useful.

All this care and pity of the king and queen, however, excited the
ingenious gratitude of the people, who raised monuments to them, as
ephemeral as the feelings which prompted them. Obelisks and pillars of
snow and ice, engraved with their names, were to be seen all over Paris.

At the end of March the thaw began, but by fits and starts, constant
returns of frost prolonging the miseries of the people. Indeed, in the
beginning of April it appeared to set in harder than ever, and the
half-thawed streets, frozen again, became so slippery and dangerous, that
nothing was seen but broken limbs and accidents of all kinds. The snow
prevented the carriages from being heard, and the police had enough to
do, through the reckless driving of the aristocracy, to preserve from the
wheels those who were spared by cold and hunger.—AFTER ALEXANDER DUMAS,
“THE QUEEN’S NECKLACE.”




_Section 248._

A STORY WORTH READING.

I.


Soon after the promulgation of Methodism[1] in England it spread with
great rapidity over the counties of Devon and Cornwall, and especially
among the miners and lower orders. For a long period after its
introduction the clergy and higher classes of society in the west of
England manifested a dislike to the new doctrines which can scarcely be
imagined in these days of modern toleration. It was thought by many young
gentlemen good sport to break the windows and nail up the doors of a
Methodist chapel[2]. The robbery of a Wesleyan preacher[3], as a spree,
by two young gentlemen, became the subject of an investigation, and the
frolicsome young men had to pay very dearly for their practical joke.

Among the uninstructed local preachers was one known by the name of “The
Old Gardener.” This old man was no common character—indeed he was quite
original, and by far the most popular preacher among the disciples of
John Wesley in the vicinity.

He kept a small nursery garden about two miles from the town of St.
A——, working hard at his occupation of gardener by day, and praying and
preaching to his fellow-sinners, as he called them, in the evening. He
lived in the poorest manner, giving away all the surplus of his earnings
in charity, distributing Bibles, and promoting to the utmost of his
ability the extension of Methodism. His complexion was a sort of dirty,
dark, iron grey, and his whole appearance lean and grotesque. Although
extremely ignorant, he possessed no small degree of cunning; of this the
following incident affords ample evidence:—

“The Old Gardener” was once subjected to a burglary and attempt at
robbery. He lived with his wife in a small and somewhat dilapidated
cottage, not far from the high road. Three young “squires,” who all
despised and hated Methodism, having heard that the old man had been
recently making a collection to build a Methodist chapel, thought it
would be a good frolic to rob him temporarily of the proceeds of this
collection. The result of the frolic is best related in the words of one
of the actors:—

“We set out,” said he, “upon our expedition with blackened faces, upon a
dark night, a little before twelve o’clock. We had dined late, and all of
us had Dutch as well as Cornish courage; yet I confess, when it came to
the point[4], I felt myself a coward. I began to reflect that it was but
a dastardly frolic to frighten the poor old man and his wife in the dead
of night.”

“The clock struck twelve. ‘Now comes the watching time of the night,’
exclaimed Tom.”

“‘Don’t let us frighten the poor couple out of their wits,’ said I.”

“‘No,’ said Ryder, ‘we will be gentle robbers—gentle as Robin Hood and
Little John.’”

“I said that I would rather return than proceed. ‘Recollect,’ said I,
‘the old fellow is an old soldier, as well as a saint, and fears nothing
human.’”

“‘Nonsense,’ exclaimed Ryder, ‘here goes[5].’ He pressed the feeble door
of the cottage in which the old man resided; it immediately gave way and
flew open. We entered and found ourselves in a sort of kitchen. To our
great surprise there was a light shining from an inner room. This made us
all hesitate.”

“‘Who is out there at this time of the night?’ exclaimed a hoarse
voice from within. I knew it to be the unmistakable voice of ‘The Old
Gardener.’”

“‘Give us your money, and no harm shall befal you,’ said Tom, ‘but we
must have your money.’”

“‘The Lord will be my defence,’ rejoined ‘The Old Gardener.’ ‘You shall
have no money from me; all in the house is the Lord’s—take it if you
dare.’”

“‘We must and will have it,’ said we, as we entered the inner room, after
taking the precaution of fastening the chamber-door as we entered.”

“We soon wished we had suffered it to remain open, as you will see.”

“Now, consider us face to face with ‘The Old Gardener,’ and a pretty
sight was presented. Three ruffians (ourselves) with white waggoners’
frocks and blackened faces; before us ‘The Old Gardener,’ sitting on the
side of his bed. He wore a red worsted nightcap, a checked shirt, and a
flannel jacket; his iron grey face, fringed with a grizzly beard, looking
as cool and undismayed as if he had been in the pulpit preaching.”

“A table was by the side of the bed, and immediately in front of him, on
a large deal table, was an open Bible, close to which we observed, to our
horror, a heap of gunpowder, large enough to blow up a castle. A candle
was burning on the table, and the old fellow had a steel in one hand
and a large flint in the other. We were all three paralysed. The wild,
iron-faced, determined look of ‘The Old Gardener,’ the candle, flint and
steel, and the great heap of powder, absolutely froze our blood, and made
cowards of us all. The gardener saw the impression he had made.”

“‘What! do you want to rob and murder?’ exclaimed he; ‘I think you had
better join with me in prayer, miserable sinners that you all are!
Repent, and you may be saved. You will soon be in another world.’”

“Ryder first recovered his speech.”

“‘Please to hear me, Mr. Gardener. I feel that we have been wrong, and if
we may depart we will make reparation, and give you all the money we have
in our pockets.’”

“We laid our purses on the table before him.”

“‘The Lord has delivered you into my hands. It was so revealed to me in a
dream. We shall all soon be in another world. Pray, let us pray.’”

“And down he fell upon his knees, close to the table, with the candle
burning, and the ugly flint and steel in his hand. He prayed and prayed.
At last he appeared exhausted. He stopped and eyed the purses, and then
emptied one of them out on the table. He appeared surprised, and, I
thought, gratified at the largeness of its contents.”

“We now thought we should have leave to retire; but, to our dismay, ‘The
Old Gardener’ said:

“‘Now, we will praise God by singing the 100th Psalm.’”

“This was agony to us all. After the Psalm, the old man took up the
second purse, and while he was examining its contents, Ryder, who was
close behind Tom and myself, whispered softly:

“‘I have unfastened the door, and when you hear me move, make a rush.’”

“‘The Old Gardener,’ then, pouring out the contents of the second purse,
exclaimed:

“‘Why, there is almost enough to build our new house of God. Let me see
what the third contains.’”

“He took up the third purse.”

“‘Now,’ whispered Ryder, ‘make a rush.’”

“We did so; and at the same moment heard the old fellow hammering away at
his flint and steel. We expected to be instantly blown into fragments.
The front door, however, flew open before us: and the next moment we
found ourselves in the garden. The night was pitchy dark. We rushed
blindly through brambles and prickly shrubs, ran our heads against trees,
and then forced our way through a thick hedge. At last, with scratched
faces, torn hands, and tattered clothes, we tumbled over a bank into the
high road.

A STORY WORTH READING.

III.


“Our horses we soon found, and we galloped to Ryder’s residence. Lights
were produced, and we sat down. We were black, ragged, and dirty. We
looked at each other, and, in spite of our miserable adventure, roared
with laughter.”

“‘We may laugh,’ exclaimed Tom, ‘but if this adventure becomes known, and
we are found out, Cornwall will be too hot for us the next seven years.
We have made a pretty night of it. We have lost our money, been obliged
to pretend to pray for two long hours, before a great heap of gunpowder,
while that grim-faced, ugly, red-capped brute threatened us with an
immediate passage into eternity. And our money forsooth must go to build
a meeting-house! Bah! It is truly horrible. The old fellow has played the
old soldier on us with a vengeance, and we shall be the laughing-stock of
the whole country.’”

“The affair was not yet ended. Reports were spread that three men
disguised as black demons, with horns and tails, had entered the
cottage of ‘The Old Gardener,’ who had not only terrified them, but had
frightened them out of a good sum of money, which he intended to devote
to the building of a new Methodist meeting-house. It was given out that
on the following Sunday ‘The Old Gardener’ intended to preach a sermon,
and afterwards solicit subscriptions for the meeting-house, when he
would relate the remarkable manner in which he had been providentially
assisted with funds for the building. Our mortification was complete.
Tom, whose hatred of Methodism was intense, declared he would blow up
the meeting-house as soon as it was built. Our curiosity, however, was
excited, and we all three determined to hear our adventure of the night
related by ‘The Old Gardener,’ if we could contrive to be present without
being suspected.”

“Sunday evening arrived. The meeting-house was crammed to suffocation;
and with the dull lights then burning in the chapel, we had no difficulty
in concealing ourselves. The sermon was short, but the statement of our
adventure was related most minutely and circumstantially in the old man’s
quaint, homely, and humorous phraseology. This evening he seemed to excel
himself, and was exultingly humorous.”

“‘I never,’ said he, ‘saw black faces pray with greater devotion. I have
some doubt, however,’ he slily observed, ‘if their prayers were quite
heavenward. They sometimes turned their faces towards the door, but a
lifting of the flint and steel kept them quiet.’”

“He then added, with a shake of the head and an exulting laugh: ‘But they
had not smelt powder like the old soldier they came to rob. No, no; it
was a large heap—ay, large enough to frighten old General Clive himself.
The candle was lighted, the flint and steel were ready. You may ask, my
friends, if I myself was not afraid. No, no, my dear friends,’ shouted
he, ‘this large stock of apparent gunpowder was—it was my whole year’s
stock of leek (onion) seed!’”

“The whole congregation somewhat irreverently laughed; even the saints
almost shouted; many clapped their hands. I was for a moment stupefied by
the announcement, but at last could hardly suppress my own laughter.”

“We subscribed to the fund to avoid suspicion, and left the meeting.
After the sermon we joined each other, but could not speak. We could
hardly chuckle ‘leek-seed,’ and then roared with laughter.”

“It was a good joke, though not exactly to our taste. It has, however,
more than once served for subsequent amusement.”

“The chapel was built with the money collected by the gardener. Time and
circumstances now induce me to think that there has been no detriment
to morality or religion by the erection of the meeting-house, which was
afterwards known as ‘The Leek-seed Chapel.’”—ST. JAMES’S MAGAZINE.

§ 13. The _ordinary_ way of arranging the words is to place the =subject=
and its adjuncts =first=, and the =predicate= with its adjuncts =after=;
as—

    +Der gute Vater+ (subj.) +ist heute Morgen mit seinen drei
    Töchtern nach London abgereist+ (predicate with adjuncts).

    The good father has left this morning for London with his three
    daughters.

=But this construction is sometimes inverted, so as to place the
predicate, or a part of the predicate, before the subject.= This is the
case:

(_a_) =In interrogative clauses=; as—

    +~Kommt~ der Mann heute?+

    Does the man come to-day?

    +~Ist~ der Vater nach London abgereist?+

    Has the father left for London?

    +~Hat~ er kein Geld bei sich?+

    Has he no money about him?

(_b_) =In imperative clauses=; as—

    +Senden Sie diesen Brief zur Post!+

    Send this letter to the post-office!

(_c_) =In exclamatory clauses=; as—

    +~Hätte~ er auf mich gehört!+

    Would he had listened to me!

(_d_) =In subordinate clauses beginning with an adverbial conjunction.=
(See § 124 of Lange’s German Grammar.)

§ 14. The _ordinary_ way of arranging the words is often departed from
for the sake of =emphasizing a part of the predicate=. In this case the
part to be emphasized is placed at the _beginning_ of the sentence, and
the =construction must be inverted=, that is to say the =subject= must be
placed =after the verb=; as—

    +~Die letzten Worte hatte~ der junge Mensch mit gehobener
    Stimme gesprochen.+

    The last words the young man had spoken with an elevated tone
    of voice.

    +~Heute kann~ er nicht abreisen, sondern morgen.+

    He cannot depart to-day, but to-morrow.

    +~Mit dem zwölf Uhr Zuge kann~ er nicht mehr fahren, denn es
    ist zu spät.+

    He cannot go by the twelve o’clock train, for it is too late.

These sentences would read in the _ordinary_ construction: +Der junge
Mensch hatte die letzten Worte mit gehobener Stimme gesprochen. Er kann
nicht heute abreisen, sondern morgen. Er kann nicht mehr mit dem zwölf
Uhr Zuge fahren, denn es ist zu spät.+ The words »+Die letzten Worte+,«
»+heute+,« »+mit dem zwölf Uhr Zuge+,« have been made _emphatic_ by being
placed at the _beginning_ of the sentence, which required the _verb_ and
the _subject_ to interchange places.

§ 15. Sometimes =a subordinate clause= (that is to say a clause dependent
on another clause, without which it would not be understood) =is made
emphatic by being placed before the principal clause=. Then also the
=subject= of the _principal clause_ must be placed =after= the =verb=; as—

    +Als er in die Stube kam, ~fand er~ mich am Schreibtische.+

    When he came into the room, he found me at the desk.

In this example the _principal_ clause is »+er fand mich am
Schreibtische+,« and the _subordinate_ clause is contained in the words
»+Als er in die Stube kam+;« this latter clause has been emphasized by
being placed before the principal clause, but it required the _principal_
clause to be _inverted_, so as to place the _subject_ (+er+) after the
_verb_ (+fand+).

Here are some more examples of the same class:

    +Weil er ein guter Junge ist, ~will~ ich ihm seine Bitte
    gewähren.+

    Because he is a good fellow, I will grant his request.

    +Nachdem er gegessen und getrunken hatte, ~ging er~ nach Hause.+

    After having eaten and drunk, he went home.


III. SUBORDINATE CLAUSES.

(See § 24.)

§ 16. In subordinate clauses beginning with a relative pronoun, a
relative conjunction, or a subordinative conjunction, =the verb= stands
=at the end=; as—

    +Man zeigte mir ein Buch, ~das~ viele schöne Bilder ~enthielt~.+

    They showed me a book which contained many beautiful pictures.

    +Wir waren im Zimmer, ~als~ er ~eintrat~.+

    We were in the room when he entered.

§ 17. When the =verb= is in a =compound tense=, the =auxiliary= verb
stands =last=; as—

    +Nachdem sie ihn ~begrüßt hatte~, kam sie schnell auf mich zu.+

    After she had welcomed him, she approached me quickly.

§ 18. When there are _two_ verbs, one of which is a verb of mood, =the
verb of mood stands last=; as—

    +Er sagte, daß er nicht ~kommen könne~.+

    He said that he could not come.

§ 19. When there are _two_ verbs, the one being an infinitive, and the
other an inflected verb, =the inflected verb stands last=; as—

    +Der Sohn starb gerade zu der Stunde, in welcher sein Vater ihn
    ~wiederzusehen hoffte~.+

    The son died the very hour his father hoped to see him again.

§ 20. When there are _two infinitives_ and _an auxiliary verb_, the
=auxiliary= verb has the =first= place, whilst the =governing infinitive=
stands =last=; as—

    +Er überlegte, wie er es ~werde vermeiden können~.+ (+können+
    is the governing verb.)

    He considered how he might be able to avoid it.

    +Er sagte, daß er es nicht ~habe thun mögen~.+ (+mögen+ is the
    governing verb.)

    He said that he did not like to do it.

§ 21. Sometimes the =conjunction=, which generally connects the
subordinate clause with the principal clause, _is_ =omitted= _and
understood_. In this case the construction is like that of a _principal
clause_; as—

    +Er fürchtete, ~ich könne~ mich erkälten.+ (+Er fürchtete, daß
    ich mich ~erkälten könne~.+)

    He was afraid I might catch cold.

§ 22. Sometimes the =auxiliary= verb is =omitted= _and understood_; as—

    +Daß er mir ~genommen~ (wurde), ist mein größtes Leid.+

    That he was taken from me is my greatest sorrow.

§ 23. =In subordinate clauses the prefixes of separable compound verbs
are not separated from the verb=; as—

    +Er war so beschäftigt, daß er in vierzehn Tagen nicht
    ~ausging~.+

    He was so busy that he did not go out for a fortnight.

§ 24. _A._ The co-ordinative conjunctions—+~aber~+, +~allein~+, +~denn~+,
+~nämlich~+, +~oder~+, +~sondern~+, +~sowohl — als~+, and +~und~+—serve
to connect two or more independent statements with each other, which
have either one common subject or predicate, or have each a subject and
predicate of their own (co-ordinate clauses). =Co-ordinative conjunctions
do not affect the regular order of construction explained in= §§ 1-12,
and generally stand at the beginning of the co-ordinate clauses which
they introduce; but +~aber~+ and +~nämlich~+ are often placed after the
verb, and sometimes even stand in the middle of the clause; as—

    +Die Frau war dem Manne früh gestorben; dieser ließ dem
    hinterlassenen Kinde ~aber~ jede mögliche Sorgfalt angedeihen.+

A subordinate clause, i.e. a clause dependent on another clause, without
which it would not be understood, is joined to a principal clause by
means of a relative pronoun, or a conjunction, which latter may be either
a relative, a subordinative, or an adverbial conjunction. (See § 124 of
Lange’s German Grammar.) The effect produced upon the construction by
relative pronouns, relative conjunctions, and subordinative conjunctions
has been explained in §§ 16-23.

_B._ =Adverbial conjunctions, like all other adverbial expressions
commencing a clause, require the verb to stand before the subject=, as
has been pointed out in § 124 of Lange’s German Grammar.




B. THE INDICATIVE MOOD.


§ 25. The Indicative Mood is the Mood of Actuality, whilst the
Subjunctive Mood is the Mood of Possibility. The nature of the Indicative
may be said to be _objective_, because it is used to express positive
facts. The nature of the Subjunctive may be said to be _subjective_,
because it represents the statement made as a mere subjective
supposition, or as resting on the mere hearsay evidence of other persons.

=The Indicative Mood denotes Positiveness and Certainty.=

=Conjunctions never determine the mood in which a verb is to be used.=
The mood is always determined by the nature of the statement we wish to
make. So one and the same verb may be followed, in the dependent clause,
either by the Indicative or the Subjunctive Mood.


EXAMPLES.

    +Der Gefangene ~ist~ tot; er ~ist~ heute Morgen gestorben.+
    (Positive statement.)

    The prisoner is dead; he died this morning.

    +Ich bin überzeugt, daß er es ~gesagt hat~.+ (Certainty.)

    I am convinced that he has said it.

    +Der Mensch ~ist~ sterblich.+ (A fact.)

    Man is mortal.

    +Ich habe gehört, daß er zum Minister ~ernannt ist~.+

    I have heard that he has been appointed a minister, (and I do
    not doubt it).

(Here the Indicative Mood is used, because I wish to imply that I have
_no doubt_ about the accuracy of the statement.)

    +Ich habe gehört, daß er zum Minister ~ernannt sei~+ (see § 30).

    I have heard that he has been appointed a minister, (but I
    rather doubt it).

(Here the Subjunctive Mood is used because I wish to express a _doubt_
about the accuracy of the statement, which is expressed in English by the
words ‘but I rather doubt it.’)




C. THE SUBJUNCTIVE (OR CONJUNCTIVE) MOOD.

(See § 25.)


§ 26. Since, in the best modern works of English Literature, we
frequently find the Indicative employed instead of the Subjunctive in
clauses of uncertainty and supposition, and since, with the exception of
the verb _to be_, it is evidently the tendency of the English language
to reject the distinction of the Subjunctive Mood, the student will
encounter no small difficulty in learning the right use of the German
Subjunctive, which is most extensively used, and gives often great power,
conciseness, and elegance to the mode of speaking.

=The Subjunctive Mood= is used both in principal and subordinate clauses,
and =denotes Uncertainty and Supposition=.


EXAMPLES.

    +Man sagt er ~sei~ gestorben+ (see § 29). (Uncertainty.)

    People say (i.e. it is rumoured) he is dead.

    +Plato glaubte, daß nur ~ein~ Gott ~sei~.+ (Supposition.)

    Plato thought that there was only _one_ God, (but that it was a
    matter of doubt).

§ 27. =The Subjunctive expresses Command, Wish, and Concession.=


EXAMPLES.

    +Er ~nehme~ seine Weite, wie’s Brauch ist!+ (Schiller.)
    (Command.)

    Let him take his distance as it is customary!

    +Gott ~sei~ mit dir!+ (Wish.)

    God be with you!

    +Er ~gehe~, wohin er Lust hat.+ (Concession.)

    He may go wherever he pleases.

§ 28. =The Subjunctive is used in Indirect Speech= (oratio obliqua),
i.e. when words which have been actually spoken are _quoted_ not as they
were spoken, but _in substance_ only; it stands especially after the
verbs +~sagen~+, to say; +~erzählen~+, to relate; +~melden~+, to report;
+~berichten~+, to relate, to report; +~hören~+, to hear; as—

    +Er sagte ihm, er ~sei~ ein Verschwender.+

    He told him he was a spendthrift.

    +Sie behauptete, sie ~habe~ den Brief nicht erhalten.+

    She asserted that she had not got the letter.

    +Sein Freund meldete, daß er nicht kommen ~könne~, mich zu
    besuchen.+

    His friend reported that he could not come to see me.

§ 29. =The Subjunctive is used when the statement made in the subordinate
clause is intended to be represented not as a fact, but as a mere idea,
as a mere conception of the person speaking.= We find it, therefore,
especially after verbs denoting _a request_, _a wish_, _a hope_, _an
apprehension_, _a permission_, _an advice_, and _a command_; as—

    +meinen+, to mean.
    +glauben+, to believe.
    +vermuten+, to presume.
    +zweifeln+, to doubt.
    +scheinen+, to seem.
    +hoffen+, to hope.
    +fürchten+, to fear.
    +wollen+, to be willing.
    +bitten+, to ask.
    +befehlen+, to command.
    +verlangen+, to demand.
    +ermahnen+, to admonish.
    +raten+, to advise.
    +bestehen+, to insist upon,

    And others of a like meaning.


EXAMPLES.

    +Lassen Sie uns ~hoffen~, daß unser Streben von Erfolg ~sein
    werde~.+

    Let us hope that our endeavours may be successful.

    +Ich bat ihn, daß er mir ~helfen möge~.+

    I asked him to help me.

    +Ich ~fürchtete~, daß er ein Bein ~gebrochen habe~.+

    I was afraid that he had broken a leg.

    +Wir ~bitten~, daß der Gefangene frei ~gelassen werde~.+

    We request that the prisoner be released.

    +Er ~zweifelt~ daran, daß man ihn für unschuldig ~erklären
    werde~.+

    He doubts if he will be declared innocent.

    +Wir werden stets ~verlangen~, daß man uns unsere Rechte
    ~gewähre~.+

    We shall always demand that our rights be given to us.

    +Ich ~rate~ dir, daß du fleißiger ~werdest~.+

    I advise you to become more industrious.

    +Ich ~bestehe darauf~, daß sich der Lord ~entferne~.+
    (Schiller.)

    I insist upon the Lord’s retiring.

§ 30. With regard to the _Tense_ in which the Subjunctive ought to stand
in subordinate clauses of the character mentioned above, the general rule
is, that—

    =We use the same tense of the Subjunctive Mood which, in
    direct speech, or in a principal clause, would be used in the
    Indicative Mood=,

except that

    =the Perfect of the Subjunctive is used instead of the
    Imperfect of the Indicative, and that the Pluperfect of the
    Indicative is changed into the Perfect of the Subjunctive,
    with the help of one of the conjunctions +ehe+, +bevor+, and
    +nachdem+.=

The following table will make this clear:—


    _Direct Speech._                           _Indirect Speech._

    +Er sagte: »Ich lese.«+              +Er sagte, er lese.+ (Present
    (Present.)                           Subj.)

    +Er sagte: »Ich habe gelesen.«+      +Er sagte, er habe gelesen.+
    (Perfect.)                           (Perfect Subj.)

    +Er sagte: »Ich werde lesen.«+       +Er sagte, er werde lesen.+
    (First Future.)                      (First Future Subjunctive.)

    +Er sagte: »Ich werde gelesen        +Er sagte, er werde gelesen haben+
    haben+ (Second Future), +wenn        (Second Future Subj.), +wenn sein
    mein Freund mich abholen wird.«+     Freund ihn abholen werde+ (First
    (First Future.)                      Future Subjunctive).

    But—                                 But—

    +Er sagte: »Ich las, als sein        +Er sagte, er =habe gelesen=, als
    Freund schrieb.«+ (Imperfect.)       sein Freund =geschrieben habe=.+
                                         (Perfect Subjunctive.)

    +Er sagte: »Ich hatte gelesen+       +Er sagte, er =habe gelesen=+
    (Pluperfect), +als mein Freund       (Perfect Subjunctive), +=ehe=
    schrieb.«+ (Imperfect.)              sein Freund =geschrieben habe=.+
                                         (Perfect Subjunctive.)

It will be seen, therefore, that =the verb= in the subordinate clause
=stands either in the Present, in the Perfect, or in the Future=.


EXAMPLES.

    +Der Diener antwortete, er ~sei~ nicht imstande die Arbeit zu
    thun, denn er ~sei~ zu schwach.+ (Present Subj.)

    The servant answered that he was unable to do the work, for he
    was too weak.

    +Er erzählte mir, er ~habe~ ein Unglück ~gehabt~.+ (Perfect
    Subj.)

    He told me he had met with a misfortune.

    +Sie behauptete, daß sie nie in ihrem Leben krank ~gewesen
    sei~.+ (Perfect Subj.)

    She affirmed that she had never been ill in all her life.

    +Er sagte, daß er sich um eine Stelle bewerben ~werde~.+ (First
    Future.)

    He said that he was going to apply for a situation.

§ 31. =The Imperfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive, however, must be used
instead of the Present and Perfect Subjunctive, and the Conditional
instead of the Future Subjunctive=, when any ambiguity might arise as to
the mood employed, that is to say in cases where the form of the Present,
of the Perfect, or of the Future is _identical_ both in the Indicative
and the Subjunctive Mood. For example, in the sentence—

    »+Sie sagte mir, ihre Töchter ~gingen~ niemals auf Bälle+;«

    ‘She said to me that her daughters never went to balls;’

the verb +~gingen~+ stands in the _Imperfect Subjunctive_ and _not_ in
the _Present_, because the third person plural of the Present Indicative
and the corresponding person of the Present Subjunctive _are identical_
in the conjugation of this verb. Both are »+~sie gehen~+,« the verb,
therefore, must be put in the _Imperfect Subjunctive_ to show clearly the
mood employed.

§ 32. =The Subjunctive is employed in adverbial clauses of purpose
and of manner=, when the subordinate clause generally begins with the
conjunctions +~daß~+, +~auf daß~+, +~damit~+, and +~als ob~+; as—

    +Du sollst deinen Vater und deine Mutter ehren, ~auf daß~ dir’s
    ~wohlgehe~ und du lange ~lebest~ auf Erden.+

    Thou shalt honour thy father and thy mother, that thou mayest
    prosper and thy days be long on earth.

    +Ist es nicht, ~als ob~ dies Volk mich zum Gott ~mache~?+
    (Schiller.)

    Does it not seem as if the people meant to make a God of me?

§ 33. =The Imperfect Subjunctive and the Pluperfect Subjunctive= are
used to express something possible, or something capable of being done,
also to denote a mere supposition on the part of the speaker, or for the
purpose of stating an opinion with _caution_ or _modesty_; as—

    +Es ~könnte~ sein, daß er nicht zu Hause ~wäre~.+

    Literally: It might be possible that he were not at home, i.e.
    He may possibly not be at home.

    +Ich ~hätte~ wohl Lust, ihm einen Besuch zu machen.+

    I should like indeed to pay him a visit.

    +Ich ~wüßte~ wohl, was zu thun ~wäre~.+

    I fancy I know what ought to be done.

    +Es ~wäre~ vielleicht besser, das Unternehmen aufzugeben.+

    Perhaps it would be better to give up the undertaking.

§ 34. =To express a wish= we use the _Present Subjunctive_, when we
believe in the fulfilment of the wish, but the _Imperfect Subjunctive_,
when we want to indicate that the fulfilment of the wish is unlikely, and
even impossible; as—

    +Gott ~sei~ mit dir!+

    God be with you!

    +~Möge~ er bald gesund werden!+

    May he soon recover his health!

    +Lang ~lebe~ der König!+

    Long live the king!

    +Gott ~helfe~ mir!+ (Luther.)

    May God help me!

But with the Imperfect Subjunctive:

    +~Möchte~ er bald gesund werden!+

    Would he might soon recover his health!

    +Wenn er doch noch ~lebte~!+

    I would he were still alive!

    +~Möchte~ er bald kommen!+

    Would he might soon come!

§ 35. It must always be remembered that both moods (the Indicative and
the Subjunctive) may stand in Principal Clauses as well as in Subordinate
Clauses, since _their use depends alone on the nature of the statement
we wish to make_ (see § 25). Nor has the notion connected with the verb
standing in the principal clause an absolute influence on the mood to
be used in the subordinate clause. The Indicative stands in subordinate
clauses not merely after verbs expressing Certainty, but also after such
as denote Belief, Supposition, and Doubt, when the statement contained
in the subordinate clause is represented _objectively_, i.e. as being
based upon a fact, or as being, in the speaker’s opinion, not open to any
doubt. So we say—

    +Ich glaube, daß er in der Schlacht geblieben ~ist~+ (not
    +sei+).

    I believe that he was killed in battle.

    +Ich weiß nicht, ob er ~lebt~, oder ob er tot ~ist~.+

    I do not know whether he is alive, or whether he is dead.

    +Ich zweifle, daß der Kranke ~genesen wird~.+

    I doubt if the patient will recover.

    +Ich hoffe, daß er sich wohl ~befindet~.+

    I hope that he is well.

But when the statement contained in the subordinate clause is represented
_subjectively_, i.e. as being based upon a mere idea or belief, the
correctness of which is still open to doubt, the Subjunctive must be
used; as—

    +Man glaubt, man sagt+, etc., +er ~sei~ in der Schlacht
    geblieben.+

    People believe, people say, etc., that he was killed in battle,
    (but it is still doubtful).

    +Er fürchtet, daß man ihn verraten ~habe~.+

    He is afraid that they have betrayed him, (yet he does not
    know).




D. THE CONDITIONAL MOOD.


§ 36. The Conditional is the mood for representing a state or an event
as dependent on another, which other, however, is not based upon a real
fact, but is a mere hypothesis or supposition. As such we use not only
the First and Second Conditional (+ich würde+, etc.), as given in the
tables of verbs, but also the Imperfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive. The
latter two, in fact, may be called the simple forms of the Conditional
Mood, and the former (+ich würde+, etc.) the compound forms. Every true
conditional statement consists of two clauses: (_a_) the hypothetical
clause, which contains the supposition, (_b_) the conditioning clause,
which contains the inference drawn from that supposition; as—

    If I had money (hypothetical clause),

    I should like to travel (conditioning clause).

The Imperfect and Pluperfect Subjunctive may be used in both clauses, but
the First and Second Conditional (+ich würde+, etc.—see the tables of
verbs) can only be used in conditioning clauses.

The conditioning clause is often introduced by »+so+.«


EXAMPLES.

    +Wenn ich Geld ~hätte~, ~ginge~ ich gern auf Reisen+ (or
    +~würde~ ich gern auf Reisen gehen+).

    If I had money, I should like to travel.

    +Wenn es heute schönes Wetter ~gewesen wäre~, so ~würden wir
    ausgegangen sein~.+

    If the weather had been fine to-day, we should have gone out.

    +Dieser Mann ~könnte~ glücklicher ~sein~, wenn er das Spiel
    nicht zu sehr ~liebte~.+

    This man might be happier, if he were not too fond of gambling.

    +Er ~würde~ gesund ~sein~+ (or +er ~wäre~ gesund+), +wenn er
    mäßiger ~lebte~+.

    He would be healthy, if he were more temperate.

§ 37. The Conditional is sometimes used _elliptically_; as—

    +Ja, ich würde gekommen sein!+

    Yes, I should have come! (i.e. if I had been able to do so,
    _understood_).

    +Unter den Umständen hätte ich es gewiß gethan.+

    I am sure, under the circumstances I should have done it (i.e.
    if I had been placed in the same situation).

    +~Wäre~ ich reich, ~würde~ ich Sie sofort bezahlen.+

    Were I rich, I should pay you directly.

    2. (instead of +c+ and +qu+) =in many words originally Latin
    or French=, but which have become quite germanised, and are
    now looked upon as altogether German words, as: +der Advoka´t+
    (_lawyer_); +das Boske´tt+ (_thicket_) from the French: le
    bosquet; +das Loka´l+ (_locality_); +das Pu´blikum+ (_public_);
    +vaka´nt+ (_vacant_); +der Vulka´n+ (_volcano_), etc.—More

    +die Flo´skeln+ (_fine words, frequently made use of with a
    deceptive purpose_).

    3. (instead of +c+) in words with the prefixes +=Ko-=+,
    +=Kol-=+, +=Kom-=+, +=Kon-=+, +=Kor-=+, and also in syllables
    containing a +=k=+-sound followed by +=t=+ (+=...kt=+),
    as in: +die Kopie´+ (_copy_); +die Kolonie´+ (_colony_);
    +der Kommanda´nt+ (_commander_); +der Ko´nstabler+
    (_constable_); +das Konze´rt+ (_concert_); +die Korresponde´nz+

    germanised, etc.—

        =Mark well=: +der Kaffee´+ (_coffee_), =but=: +das Café+
        (_a fine restaurant where mostly coffee is served_).

    =NOTE.= In foreign words which have preserved a foreign
    pronunciation, or certain foreign forms of spelling or
    inflection, do not use +=k=+, but +=c=+, as in: +die Campagne+
    (_campaign_); +der Commi´s+ (_clerk_); +das Flaco´n+
    (_smelling-bottle_); +der Redakteu´r+ (_editor_); +die
    Adjecti´va+ (_adjectives_), etc.

    =Doubtful Orthography.= We find: +Konze´rt+ _and_ +Conce´rt+,
    n.; +Ka´rzer+ (_prison in schools and universities_) _and_
    +Ca´rcer+, m.; +Komitee´+ _and_ +Comite´+, n.; +Kompanie´+
    _and_ +Compagnie´+, f.; +conze´ntrisch+ (_concentric_) _and_
    +conce´ntrisch+; +Konzessio´n+ _and_ +Concessio´n+, f.;
    +Konzi´l+ (_council_) _and_ +Conci´l+, n.; +klassifizie´ren+
    (_to classify_) _and_ +classificie´ren+; +Ku´rsus+ (_course
    of study_) _and_ +Cu´rsus+, m.; +korre´kt+ _and_ +corre´ct+;
    +Konjunktio´n+ _and_ +Conjunctio´n+, etc., etc.

    From these examples it will be seen that the mode of spelling
    is fluctuating between +=k=+ and +=c=+, and +=c=+ and +=z=+,
    in many words which originally contained the letter =c=. =The
    first way is to be preferred, and strongly recommended, in
    all the words given above, and many others in common use that
    contain a= +=k=+ =or a= +=z=+=-sound and are quite germanised
    in spelling and inflection.= (Comp. C. 3.)

    Use also +=k=+ instead of +=c=+ in words of Greek origin which
    have preserved the +=k=+-sound, as:—+Anekdo´te+, +katho´lisch+,
    +Komö´die+, +Diale´kt+, etc.—[Comp. B, letter +=k=+,
    1.]—And write +=c=+ and +=cq=+, as before, in: +A´cce´nt+,
    +A´ccusati´v+, +A´cquisitio´n+, etc.—

+=-nis=+

    (instead of +niß+) as a suffix of nouns, as in: +das Ereignis+
    (_event_); +das Begräbnis+ (_burial_); +das Verhältnis+
    (_relation_); +das Vermä´chtnis+ (_bequest_), etc.—

    =The prefix= +miß...+, however, remains unchanged, as in:
    +das Mi´ßverständnis+ (_misunderstanding_), pl. +die
    Mi´ßverständnisse+.

+=s=+

    (instead of +ß+) in +deshalb+ (_therefore_); +deswegen+
    (_therefore_, _for this reason_); +indes+ (_meanwhile_,
    _whilst_; _however_); +unterdes+ (_meanwhile_, _whilst_);
    +weshalb+ (_why_); +weswegen+ (_why_), etc.—

+=sſ=+

    (instead of +ſſ+) in: +dasſelbe+ (_the same_); +desſelben+
    (_of the same_); +diesſeits+ (_on this side_), etc.

+=st=+

    (instead of +ſt+) in: +Dienstag+ (_Tuesday_); +Geburtstag+
    (_birthday_); +Frühlingstag+ (_spring-day_), and other compound
    nouns in which +s+ occurs as a sign of the Genitive and is
    followed by a +t+.

+=ſſ=+

    between two vowels, the first one of which is short, as in
    +laſſen+ (_to let_, _to leave_); +die Taſſe+ (_cup_); +trotz
    deſſen+ (_in spite of that_); +weſſen+ (_whose_), etc.—

+=ß=+

    1. between two vowels, the first one of which is long, as in:
    +bü´ßen+ (_to atone for_); +schießen+ (_to shoot_), etc.

    2. before +t+, and at the end of words, as in: +er läßt+ (_he
    leaves_); +ihr laßt+ (_you leave_); +gebüßt+ (_atoned for_);
    +laß+ (_let_); +der Kuß+ (_kiss_), etc.—

+=t=+

    (instead of +dt+) in: +der Tote+ (_a dead man_ or _person_);
    +tot+ (_dead_); +töten+ (_to kill_); +der Totschlag+
    (_manslaughter_); +der Totengräber+ (_gravedigger_),
    etc.—Comp. letter +=d=+ (instead of +dt+.)

+=t=+

    (instead of +d+) in: +das Brot+ (_bread_).

+=t=+

    (and never +z+) in the accented and original Latin
    combinations:—tia´, tie´, tio´, as in +martia´lisch+,
    +Patie´nt+, m., +Natio´n+, f., +Traditio´n+, f., +Motio´n+,
    etc.

        =But write=: +Gra´zie+, +Ingredie´nzien+, etc., =e being
        unaccented=.

+=z=+

    1. (instead of +tz+) after a long vowel, as in: +die Bre´zel+
    (_biscuit in the shape of a twisted ring_, _cracknel_); +du´zen+
    (_to call a person thou_), etc.

    2. (instead of +Cz+ and +Sc+) in: +der Zar+ (_czar_); +das
    Zepter+ (_sceptre_), etc.

    3. (instead of +ce+) =regularly at the end of foreign words
    with German pronunciation= and terminating in French in =ce=,
    and in Latin in =tia=, =tius=, =tium=, =cius=, =cium=, as in:
    +das Benefi´z+, +die Justi´z+, +das Hospi´z+, +die Mili´z+,
    +die Noti´z+; +die Differe´nz+, +die Sente´nz+, +die Vaka´nz+;
    +die Fina´nzen+, +die Novi´ze+, +die Allia´nz, die Dista´nz+,
    etc.—(=But= with foreign pronunciation: +Alliance+, +Distance+,
    etc.)

    4. also in words quite germanised, as: +der Bezi´rk+
    (_district_, _circuit_); +die La´nze+ (_lance_); +die Polizei´+
    (_police_); +der Polizi´st+ (_policeman_); +das Terzero´l+
    (_pocket-pistol_); +das Terze´tt+ (_trio_), etc.—=But write=:
    +Cä´sar+, +die Cäsu´r+ (_cesure_, _cesura_); +die Ce´der+, +die
    Celebritä´t+, +die Censu´r+ (_censorship_), +censie´ren+ (_to
    censure_, _to review_), +der Ce´ntime´ter+, +die Cerea´lien+
    (_cereals_), +das Cöliba´t+, +der Ci´rkumfle´x+, +das Lyce´um+,
    etc.

    5. (instead of +c+) in verbs terminating in +=...ie´ren=+, as:
    +fabrizie´ren+ (_to manufacture_); +musizie´ren+ (_to make
    music_); +publizie´ren+ (_to publish_), etc.

    =Note.= In many words which originally contained the letter
    +=c=+, the mode of spelling is unsettled and fluctuating
    between +=c=+ and +=z=+, as in: +Medizi´n+ _and_ +Medici´n+,
    f.; +das Rezept+ _and_ +Recept+, n. (_prescription_, _recipe_);
    +Prinzi´p+ _and_ +Princi´p+, n. (_principle_); +Proze´nt+ _and_

C. +Allgemeine Bemerkungen über die Schreibung der Fremdwörter.+

(=General Observations on the Spelling of Foreign Words.=)

1. =With foreign words= containing sounds and combinations of sounds =not
originally German=, THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE regarding their orthography is
=that, their foreign pronunciation being preserved, also the foreign garb
of their orthography is retained.=

=So, for example, we use:—=

  +=oi=+ (sounded as in French) in: +die Memoi´ren+ (_memoirs_);
    +die Toile´tte+ (_toilet_).

  +=g=+ and +=j=+ (sounded as in French) in: +die Baga´ge+
    (_luggage_); +das Logi´s+ (_lodgings_); +der Genda´rm+ (_a
    police-officer on horseback_); +das Genie´+ (_genius_;
    _a man of great talent_); +der Ingenieu´r+ (_engineer_);
    +das Journa´l+ (_journal_, _magazine_); +rangie´ren+ (_to
    arrange_), etc.—=But with German pronunciation=: +der Genera´l+
    (_general_); +genia´l+ (_highly gifted_); +die Genialitä´t+
    (_geniality_, _originality_), etc.—

  +=gn=+ (sounded as in French) in: +der Champa´gner+
    (_champaign_); +die Lorgne´tte+ (_lorgnette_, _eye-glass_), etc.

  +=ll=+ (sounded like English l followed by y) in: +das
    Bataillo´n+ (_battalion_); +das Bi´llard+ (_billiards_); +das
    Bille´t+ (_ticket_; _note_); +der Postillo´n+ (_postillion_),
    etc.

  +=n=+ (sounded as in French, but not quite so nasal) in: +die
    Nua´nce+ (_gradation of colours_); +das Bassi´n+ (_reservoir_);
    +der Refrai´n+ (_refrain_); +der Rayo´n+ (_ray of light_; [of a
    fortification]: _radius_); +das Violonce´ll+ (_violoncello_),
    etc.

2. =Many foreign words, on the other hand, composed of German sounds,
which might be indicated by German letters, have as yet preserved their
original orthography. So we find:—=

  +=ai=+ (for the sound of +ä+) in: +die Chai´se+ (_chaise_),
    from the French;

  +=au=+ _and_ +=eau=+ (for the sound of +o+) in: +die Sau´ce+
    (_sauce_); +das Bureau+ (_office_), from the French;

  +=ch=+ (for the sound of +sch+) in: +die Chaussee´+
    (_turnpike-road_), from the French;

  +=ch=+ (for the Greek +k+-sound) in: +der+ _or_ +das Chor+
    (_choir_ or _chorus_), from the Greek;

  +=ph=+ (for the sound of +f+) in: +der Philoso´ph+
    (_philosopher_), from the Greek;

  +=th=+ (for the sound of +t+) in: +der Thron+ (_throne_), from
    the Greek; and

  +=v=+ (for the German +w+-sound) in: +viole´tt+ (_violet-blue_,
    adj.), from the French.

3. =Again we find foreign words which, being in common use and composed
of German sounds, have become entirely germanised, and wear a German
garb=; as: +die Tru´ppe+ (_troop_, _company_), French: la troupe; +die
Gru´ppe+ (_group_), French: la groupe; +der Disku´rs+ (_discourse_),
French: le discours; +der Sekretä´r+ (_secretary_), French: le secrétaire.

=It follows from the three preceding paragraphs:—that it is impossible to
reduce the spelling of foreign words to any fixed principles, and that
there exists at present much uncertainty and inconsistency respecting the
spelling of such words.= [Comp. B, Consonants, Note to letter +=k=+, also
B, letter +=z=+, where additional examples are given.]


D. +Kleinschreibung und Zusammenziehung.+

(=Small Initials= [_instead of Capitals_] =and Contractions.=)

=USE SMALL INITIALS:—=

1. =With Nouns used as Prepositions, Conjunctions, Indefinite Numerals,
and Adverbs=, as in: +angesichts+ (_in the face of_); +infolge+ (_in
consequence of_); +behufs+ (_on behalf of_);—+falls+ (_in case of_);—+ein

are strongly accented, and treated as separable particles, i.e. are
separated from the verb and placed at the end of the clause when used
in a principal sentence and in a simple tense. Such Verbal-Combinations
are:—+re´cht haben+ (_to be right_); +u´nrecht haben+ (_to be wrong_);

(_to leave in the lurch_), etc.—+Er hält haus+; +es ist mir zustatten
gekommen+; +es hat überhandgenommen+; +es ist mir zuteil geworden+.
=But=: +Er hat keinen Teil an mir+, etc.

3. =With Pronouns and Numerals, as=:—+jemand+, +niemand+, +jeder+,

(+das+) +nämliche+, +der erste+, +der letzte+, +der zweite+, +der
nächste+, +der erste beste+, +ein jeglicher+, etc.

=But=:—=Use Capital Initials= (as before):—

    (_a_) =with Ordinal Numerals and Adjectives preceded by the
    definite article and used in apposition to a proper noun=, as:
    +Friedrich der Zweite+; +Karl der Große+, etc.

    (_b_) =With Pronouns and Adjectives in titles=, as:—+Se.
    Majestät der König+; +das Kaiserliche Zollamt+ (_the Imperial
    Custom-House_); +der Wirkliche Geheimrat von Humboldt+ (_the
    Privy Councillor von Humboldt_).

    (_c_) =With Pronouns used in addressing persons, more
    especially in letters=, as:—+Sie genießen mein volles
    Vertrauen+; +wir glauben Ihnen alles+; +das Haus Ihrer
    Eltern war mir stets geöffnet+; +ich will Dir bald mehr
    davon erzählen+; +stets bleibe ich Dein Dich liebender Sohn
    Heinrich+, etc.

4. =In Adjectival and Adverbial Clauses=, as:—+groß und klein+ (_grown
up people and children_); +arm und reich+ (_poor and rich people_); +alt
und jung+, +durch dick und dünn+;—+am besten+, +fürs erste+, +bei weitem+
(_by far_); +aufs deutlichste+, +im allgemeinen+, +im ganzen+, +im
folgenden+, +im wesentlichen+ (_essentially_, _in all essential points_);
+von neuem+, +vor kurzem+, +im voraus+ (_beforehand_); +von vorne+, +ohne
weiteres+, +um ein beträchtliches+, etc.—=and also in idiomatic phrases=,
such as:—+Er zieht den kürzern dabei+ (_he is the loser by it_); +ich
will Ihnen Ihre Unarten zugute halten+ (_I will bear with your rudeness_;
_I will excuse your incivilities_); +der Junge hat Sie zum besten+ (_the
boy amuses himself at your expense_); +ich will es Ihnen zuliebe thun+
(_I will do it to please you_), etc.


E. +Zerlegung der Wörter in Silben.+

(=Division of Words into Syllables.=)

1. When part of a German word has to be separated from the rest in order
to be carried on to the next line, the division into Syllables is made
as we would naturally deliver them whilst pronouncing the word very
slowly and distinctly. The compound letters: +=ch=+, +=ck=+, +=dt=+,
+=pf=+, +=ph=+, +=sch=+, +=sp=+, +=st=+, +=ß=+, +=th=+, and +=tz=+,
=should, as a rule, not be separated=. [For exceptions see § 2 of this
chapter.] Examples:—+ru-hen+, +die-ser+, +Son-ne+, +Mut-ter+, +Mit-tag+,

LANGE’S GERMAN COURSE

CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING WORKS:—


THIRD EDITION, with the German spelling revised to meet the requirements
of the German Government Regulations of 1880.

THE GERMANS AT HOME; A Practical Introduction to German Conversation,
with an _Appendix_, containing _the Essentials of German Grammar_, and
a synopsis of the changes the German spelling has undergone through the
Government Regulations of 1880.

                                                          [Price _2s. 6d._


SECOND EDITION, CAREFULLY REVISED.

THE GERMAN MANUAL; _A German Grammar_, _A Reading-book_, and _A Handbook
of Conversation in German_.

                                                          [Price _7s. 6d._

‘The German Manual’ is intended to follow ‘The Germans At Home.’ It
contains, besides a complete Grammar, a series of interesting anecdotes,
stories, fables, letters, and conversations arranged in progressive
order, and finishes with a German Play, and Franz Hoffman’s well written
and highly interesting story of ‘BEETHOVEN,’ especially adapted for this
work. It offers great advantages for self-instruction, and will be very
useful to persons who, having a certain knowledge of German, desire to
obtain fluency in speaking and writing the language.


A GRAMMAR OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE, in two Parts. Part I, Accidence; Part
II, Syntax. With an _Appendix_, comprehending:—

      I. The Declension of German Nouns.
     II. Essentials of Construction.
    III. Essentials of Word-building.
     IV. The Use and signification of the Auxiliary Verbs of Mood.
      V. On Punctuation.

                                                          [Price _3s. 6d._

The ‘Grammar’ forms the first part of the ‘German Manual’ and, in this
separate form, is intended for the use of students who wish to make
themselves acquainted with German Grammar chiefly for the purpose of
being able to read German books. It is divided into paragraphs, and will
commend itself as a text-book to the notice of teachers who, in pursuing
the study of German Literature with their pupils, require a Grammar in a
concise form for reference and study.


THIRD EDITION, with the German spelling revised to meet the requirements
of the German Government Regulations of 1880.

GERMAN COMPOSITION; A Theoretical and Practical Guide to the art of
Translating English Prose into German; with an Appendix containing,
among other matters, a synopsis of the changes the German spelling has
undergone through the Government Regulations of 1880.

                                                          [Price _4s. 6d._

                     [_A Key to the above, price 5s._]

The book has been arranged so that it may be used with advantage by
students who do not possess the author’s other works.


SYNOPSIS OF THE CHANGES THE GERMAN SPELLING HAS UNDERGONE THROUGH THE
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS OF 1880; a concise and easy Guide for English
students of German desirous of adopting the new official German spelling.
Reprinted from ‘German Composition.’

[=Any one of the preceding books, being complete in itself, may be
used independently of any other book in the series, according to the
requirements of the student.=]


_EXTRACTS FROM OPINIONS ON H. LANGE’S GERMAN COURSE._

‘=The works bear evidence of remarkable painstaking, great teaching
power, and a thorough understanding of the art of teaching.=’—DR. KARL
DAMMANN, _Lecturer on the German Language and Literature at the Mason
Science College, Queen’s College, and the Midland Institute, Birmingham_.


‘The Germans at Home.’

‘The author is a practical teacher, and we are glad to recommend
his work as likely to reduce, as far as possible, the inevitable
difficulties to be encountered in the first study of a foreign language.
Happy boys and girls of the present day, if they only knew their own
blessings!’—_Journal of Education._

‘“The Germans at Home” consists of forty conversations, intended to
illustrate one day out of the life of a German family at home, as its
name implies. The result is a decided improvement upon the run of books
of this class. The interest of the student is sustained throughout, and
everything is done in fact, which can be done to create a royal road to a
knowledge of German.’—_Manchester Courier._

‘“The Germans at Home” is an excellent book, and is likely to be
extensively used.’—_Schoolmaster._

‘The traits called “new” in this Course are thus defined by the author.
“First the Facts, and then the Theory, the Laws and the Inferences.”
“The Germans at Home” (printed in Roman characters) contains forty
conversations, all connected, so as “to illustrate one day out of the
life of a German family at home.” The themes are German, the idioms are
modern, and the “variations” that follow the conversations seem likely to
be useful.’—_Athenæum._


‘A Grammar of the German Language.’

‘The author has obviously studied to make as clear as possible
the arrangement of his materials, and the printer has aided that
endeavour.’—_Athenæum._

‘The Grammar is a good one.’—_Schoolmaster._


‘The Germans at Home’ and ‘The German Manual.’

‘Instead of wearying the unhappy student with learning a lot of dry and
elaborate technicalities of accidence and syntax at the outset, Mr.
Lange starts him with conversations—forty in number, each illustrative
of one day out of the life of a German family at home—and very soon
lands him “in medias res” by the aid of interlinear translation, by the
means of which he can gain a knowledge of the idioms and peculiarities
of structure of the language, while he is at the same time acquiring
a knowledge of the theory of the language, i.e. of its accidence and
syntax. Thus we get in Mr. Lange’s system the facts first, and then
proceed to the theory, laws, and inferences—first the life and spirit,
then the form and body in which they are clothed. Only those who have
themselves learnt and taught (or tried to learn and teach) German, can
thoroughly appreciate the advantages of this plan, which avails itself
of the two leading principles which underlie all learning, and ought to
form the basis of all teaching, viz. the principles of imitation and of
variation. When we remember the long and weary hours spent by ourselves
in learning German, we envy Mr. Lange’s pupils, and those who have the
chance of using his books.’—_Manchester Critic._

‘Mr. Lange’s “German Course” is thoroughly trustworthy and
useful.’—_Glasgow News._

‘Herr Lange has worked out his principle most successfully.’—_Edinburgh
Daily Review._


‘The German Manual.’

‘This is a very elaborate work. It contains an amount of matter unusually
great, and of unquestionable excellence. If not _multum in parvo_, it
is at least _multum in uno_. The bigness of the book is largely due to
the fact that the author has amalgamated with this volume the entire
grammar, which is also published in a separate form. The grammar is
a good one; but the special feature of the “German Manual” consists
in its comprehensiveness, which will be apparent from the following
summary of its contents:—Part I. Accidence. Part II. Syntax. Part III.
Interlinear Translation. Part IV. German for Translation into English.
Part V. Notes and Helpful Hints. Part VI. English Version of Part IV. for
Re-translation. By an ingenious system of adaptation, the six parts are
to be proceeded with simultaneously. Thus every part throwing light upon
the rest, and the student having to deal with the same passages over and
over again, the process of mental assimilation is likely to be rendered
more real and rapid. When we add that the book contains a humorous comedy
and an excellent life of Beethoven, our readers will acknowledge that
Herr Lange has provided that variety which is proverbially charming. From
the conspicuous absence of the namby-pamby element—unfortunately too
common in translation exercises—as well as from the general excellence of
the work, it may be confidently recommended, especially for the use of
adult students.’—_Schoolmaster._

‘Herr Lange’s method is excellent for simplicity and
clearness.’—_Saturday Review._


‘German Composition.’

‘Having used H. Lange’s Composition for about a couple of years with
my advanced pupils, I am in a position to state that it has more than
answered the very favourable expectations I had formed on a first perusal
of the work. To my mind its chief recommendations are:—

1st. It may safely be put into the hands of learners at an earlier stage
than most works of this class.

2nd. The judicious manner in which the exercises have been graduated, and
the careful elucidation of all grammatical difficulties.

3rd. The admirable rendering of English idioms into their German
equivalents.’—JOHN J. T. JACKSON, _Lecturer on Modern Languages and
Philology at the Lancashire Independent College, and the Wesleyan
College, Didsbury_.

‘After a very careful perusal of “Hermann Lange’s German Composition,” I
have no hesitation to say that it seems to me to be the best book of that
kind,—not only with regard to the choice of good extracts from modern
English authors, but also in respect to the thoroughness and correctness
of the Notes. I shall find it exceedingly useful with my pupils for the
Army and Civil Service Examinations.’—THEODORE H. DITTEL, _London, Tutor
to Students preparing for the Army and Civil Service Examinations_.

‘I prefer the book to all others on German Composition.’—ERNEST R.
MORGAN, _London_.

‘We begin with simple stories of two or three sentences each, and so
fully annotated that they may be read off into German by a pupil who
knows his first accidence, and ascend by easy gradients to Sir Walter
Scott and Macaulay.

‘=It is throughout a careful, accurate, and scholarly piece of
work.=’—_Journal of Education._

Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.


START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™
electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at www.gutenberg.org. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

    • You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
        Literary Archive Foundation.”
    
    • You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
        works.
    
    • You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    
    • You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
    

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.

The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit www.gutenberg.org/donate.

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
